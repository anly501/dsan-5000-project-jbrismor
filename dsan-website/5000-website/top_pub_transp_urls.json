He told me my mother packed up and left us when I turned 2 years old.\n\nI grew up to resent and hate her. Mainly because I saw how my father was working super long hours to make ends meet. I hated how my grandma basically had to raise me.\n\nWhen I would ask her about my mother, my grandma painted a picture of a bitter, spiteful, hateful spoiled/ entitled woman. I felt very justified in my anger and hate for her. That's what my family told me and I had absolutely no reason to doubt them.\n\nA few weeks ago I found her on social media while at my boyfriend's house. And I was so.fucking.mad.She was out there living her best life. She is a cook ( chef?) in a Michelin star restaurant. She travels, has a huge apartment, and apparently is married to a gorgeous man.\n\nIn a fit of rage, I DM'd her cruising her out for abandoning me to live her frivolous life and that karma would come to her.\n\nShe obviously saw it. Instead of going off on me she just asked me to meet her and that she felt like I had a right to express my anger to her in person and that she owed me as much.I was starstruck because my father said she never stood for the consequences of her actions.\n\nWithout telling anyone I agreed. She invited me to this amazing restaurant. She paid an Uber for me and everything.\n\nIt was very awkward at the beginning. I kept berating her. I was so angry. I cried a little. She just sat there and took it all in. I then asked her...why she abandoned me.She then asked ( this is all paraphrased) \" Do you really want to know the whole story? It is not nice and you will not like it. I am ready to be the bad guy in your head forever and keep my distance.\"I just kept pressing her. And then she told me the real story. This is again paraphrased and to my best recollection.\n\nShe told me that my father and she met shortly before ending Uni. At that time my mother had said she did not want to stay in uni town.A few months after dating my father told her, that his landlord was evicting him because the apartment was needed for immediate family use. She offered him to stay while he found something else.\n\nMoths passed and he was not doing anything. Then she got a job offer in another country. She told my father, that he could take over her apartment or come with her. They had this huge fight where my mother told him that she was not ready for the type of commitment he wanted. She wanted different things in life than him and that as much as she loved him...that they weren't compatible.They stayed living together and then one day she found out she was pregnant. She told me honestly, that she was thinking of not having me. She did not feel ready to be a mom at 22. She did not feel maternal feelings. She said she was already struggling with depression and late-diagnosed ADHD.\n\nMy father convinced her to have me. He said he would take me because he had a right to me. That he would go after her because that baby was also his. So she had me.She said that the time after birth was really bad. My father was dragging out the legal procedures, he refused to vacate the home. My mother said that while she felt love for me and that there were moments when she felt overjoyed, it was overshadowed by huge waves of suicidal ideation. She was scared that she was gonna hurt me. She also showed me some of the court documents of that time that backed up her claims.\n\nIn the end, she was so desperate that she agreed to stay with my father if he agreed to be the main caretaker. He did but only half-assed. My mother then told me that it got so bad, that she tried to commit suicide around my second birthday after a particularly nasty fight where my father admitted to having tampered with her birth control. She showed me the papers of the involuntary 72 hours commitment and the legal documents where she was found unfit to be a parent afterwardI felt nauseous after all that. I would have not believed her, hadn't she brought so much \"evidence\" with her.\n\nShe then asked me what I meant in my message that we were struggling.I told her that we were not exactly rich and that I was struggling to come up with the money to go to University in another city. She was bewildered and asked me what my father had been doing with the monthly payments she was making.\n\nI told her that we don't receive that money. Then she took out another stack of papers. .... Guys.... she is sending child support every month. It is almost 3k every. month.Edit: She is court-mandated to pay me 1.5k. She doubled the payments out of her own will. She doesn't have to pay that amount. She wants to\n\nShe was very concerned about this and told me she would talk to her lawyers ASAP to transfer the money to me directly.In the end, she apologized to me. She is very sorry to have put me through this. She was very sorry for not being stronger and she was very sorry for letting me grow up the way I did. She was crying... I was crying.\n\nShe then told me to take my time. She would contact me again regarding the payments and that it was up to me if I wanted to see her again. That she couldn't be the mother i wanted but the least she could do is help me with anything that I need.I hugged her. I cried. She cried. I boxed up my food and she got me another uber home.At home, my father was not there. So I went straight to bed and left early the next morning and am staying with my boyfriend. My whole life is a lie.\n\n[Just found records of domestic violence from my father(42f) to my mother (40f). My(m18)life keeps crumbling.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vxk2nu/just_found_records_of_domestic_violence_from_my/) 12 July 2022\n\nI have found out that my mother never really abandoned me because she didn\\`t want me, but because she tried to commit suicide and was deemed unfit to parent and that my father basically baby trapped my mother with me.\n\nAfter the post yesterday, I went snooping even more because I do not trust my father anymore.I found records of domestic abuse perpetrated by my father toward my mother. He was charged but never ended up going to jail or did a very reduced sentence. This would have been when I was 2 after my mother was committed. I also found a Restraining Order filed by my mother against my father.It was so much worse than what she said. He did not only abuse her emotionally but also physically. I am feeling so disgusted. I could just scream.\n\nI returned to my boyfriend again. My father has been calling a lot asking why I had spent so much time away from home.RN my excuse is a family emergency of my boyfriend.After yesterday's I wanted to confront him but now I don't feel safe. Any advice?\n\n[Caught my father(m42) in a lie... should I(m18) just cut my losses and cut him off from my life?](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/vzs3z5/caught_my_fatherm42_in_a_lie_should_im18_just_cut/) 15 July 2022\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy life was put upside down for the past weeks.Tldr is that I found out my mother did not abandon me but tried to commit and was deemed an unfit parent due to her mental issues. She was giving my father 3k a month as child support. 1.5k was court-mandated 1.5k was out of her own will.I also found court records of my father being charged with physically assaulting my mother on more than one occasion.\n\nSo after staying for a while with my boyfriend, I decided to go home for a while because I wanted to get my legal documents and all of that. My father came back home and we talked a bit. I just asked him \" by the way.... did my mother never send you child support for me?\"My father just scoffed theatrically and went on this rant about how courts are always accessible to the mother and how they told him he couldn't expect anything from her and so on. He pulled that whole story of him begging her for money when he didn't have enough money for my school supplies and her turning him down.\n\nI know this is a lie. My mother kept itemized records of all her money wires to my father. every month since she had a job. meaning for over 15 years she has sent my father money. In the beginning, she sends him 400, then 600, then 1000, and eventually 3000.Then he kept talking saying how hard it was. That he wished he would have gone after her more. But that the courts were not in his favor. He told me how even now we were barely able to go paycheque to paycheque.\n\nHis rant was surreal.After he left to go god knows where I went snooping through his room where I found a stack of cash in his sock drawer. It was over 5k crammed into the back of his drawer.Things are getting worse. I feel so weird. I can not describe the ick. I have all my documents and wrote my mother so we could maybe meet again.Should I just ghost my father?\n\n[Update: I(m18) just found out that my father(m42) baby trapped my mother(f40) with me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/w8waj2/update_im18_just_found_out_that_my_fatherm42_baby/) 26 July 2022\n\nCAUTION VERY LONGWhat has happened in my other two posts?\n\nI found court documents that confirmed that my mother had been physically assaulted by my father. Upon further research, I determined that my father spent 3 months in jail for the assault. That was when I was 4 years old, which would explain why I do not remember anything at all about that.I met with him a few days ago. This is when I asked again about Child support. Posing the question like \" Hey dad, did my mother never give you any child support for me?\". He denied ever receiving Child support, citing that courts will go easy on women.\n\nThat same day I snooped around and found a stack of cash with over 5k in one of his drawers. I did have the data to the household account, but the 3k monthly payment was never figured in that account. Also, I scouted for withdrawals for more than 100 dollars at a time that maybe could explain the 5k stack ( which was only composed of 100-dollar bills). Nada.Some background\n\nUntil posting here, I never realized that my relationship with my father was not normal. I explain more about his behavior in the previous, but as a bit of an explanation :He made me his \"accountant\" from a very young age. I had to keep track of expenses etc. And so many times I was having panic attacks because we would not make it to the end of the month with the money on the account. So many times my father would berate me if I ever asked to go out (e.g to the cinema) because we couldn't afford it.\n\nWhen he would allow me to go out it was always attached to an endless list of requirements that were absurd. Again let's take the example of the cinema. I would ask him a week prior and he'd say yes but that I had to clean the house, drive grandma to the doctor, pick up xy, Leave some dinner ready for me, and many more. So that if I did not complete one single detail ( like not bringing out the trash) he would pick up a fight with me making me feel guilty and thus staying home.\n\nHe would constantly make me feel worthless. Saying I would not survive in uni, that I was not talented to do this, that I was not good enough to do that.He is extremely reactive. one time in the car I teased him that I would be for the other football( soccer) team tonight and he kicked me out of the car making me walk home alone.There are so many more examples. I thought it was merely my fault or that other dad were also like this. But suffice to say... it is not normal.\n\nWhat happened now?I did in fact contact my mother after finding all this out.I \"confronted\" her with the newfound information. She admitted that it was quite bad and she did fear for her life. My father apparently had friends in law enforcement that were following my mother and making her life impossible ( giving her tickets for the most inconsequential stuff, pulling her over for random \"controls\") everything possible to intimidate her or to find dirt on her.\n\nMy father put her to the ultimatum of just singing over without a fight or he would make her any my life impossible. My mother told me that he had been abusing her since I was born. As early as one-week postpartum. So when my father uttered the ultimatum she felt hopeless and just tried to end it.It did not work and after she was released my father served her and battled for full custody. Because she was deemed unfit to parent it was really easy for him. She told me the court actually went pretty hard on her.\n\nAbout a year after that my mother attempted to establish visitation with me. She reached out to my father who invited her over. He told her that she could be in my life if she agreed to be together with him again. My mother told him no and then a fight ensued. That was the night he assaulted her. He assaulted her so badly that she wound up in the hospital. In the hospital seeing her wounds they had to report it. So he was sentenced to a year but only served 3 months.At that time custody of me was with my grandmother. My father resumed custody of me at the time of being release.\n\nI was able to corroborate all this after reaching out to my aunt who has not spoken to our family in 10 years. My aunt Mia basically documented my mother's abuse. She took pictures of her bruises, and recordings of my father screaming and threatening her. She told me that she testified against my father in court and that she could just back up everything my mother said because he was the same to her.\n\nI insisted on seeing the pictures and recordings. My aunt was resistant to this. But apart of me did not want to accept that this was reality. So yeah... my father is a fucking monster.I told my mother about everything monetarily that I had found out. She said that legally there was not much we could do. But she spoke with her lawyer and seeing as I am 18 she started the motion to start transferring me my Child support money. She said that for the time being she would give me 1.5k monthly while she still had to pay my dad the money. As soon as the process is greenlit I am going to get it all. She also agreed to pay for my Matriculation fees as well as for the deposit and first month's rent of an apartment in my uni town so that I could be as independent as possible. For now, I have only sent in my applications a couple of weeks ago, so I should get any news on that front latest by September. We decided that confronting my father was not a good idea. For neither of us.\n\nSo we decided on telling my father that my boyfriend's parents invited me to vacation. But he does not know I am gay. So we plan on telling him that this is the last vacation to say goodbye to my friend.I have talked to my boyfriend and his parents. They did not even hesitate and immediately said yes. They now know everything and support me 100 percent. So my mother and his parents are sending us for 2 weeks to a nearby country where they have a summer house.\n\nI told my father about the plans and he said that as long as his parents were paying that it was alright. He did tell me that I had to help him with a million things before leaving again. So I am already seeing a fight on the horizon.But I have managed to get all my important documents and open a bank account thanks to my Aunt's help.\n\nSo on Thursday, I am officially leaving for 2 weeks and I pray things to get resolved beforehand. I am taking all important stuff with me already in case things go south fast.\n\nAnyways. This has been an extremely difficult time. And I feel overwhelmed with this all.\n\nSo please don't reach out probing me for an Update. I will update when I feel it is right and when i feel like I can do it. This has been very helpful. Without you guys, I would have never noticed that I had also been abused and that there is most likely more to the story. Even more than what I have found out. It has also proven very therapeutic to write this all down in a somewhat orderly fashion. So thank you so much for all the support and advice.\n\n[NEW UPDATE: I(m18) just found out that my father(m42) baby trapped my mother(f40) with me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/wrvcjj/new_update_im18_just_found_out_that_my_fatherm42/)18 August 2022\n\nI AM NOT IN THE US. Don't speculate with US laws and standards. They do not apply\n\nI am the original OP. I saw that u/alejamix had posted a recompilation of my posts on this sub and I figured this is the best way to reach out to all of you who have written me and are curious as to what is happening.\n\nThis is the link to the original threat here with all the older UpdatesThings went south fast.\n\nThe Wednesday night, the night before I left, my father picked up a fight with me for not taking his car for an oil change. He called me everything under the sun. Saying I am selfish and a brat, that he raised me better.\n\nHe then had my grandmother come and say how disappointed they were. That I was clearly not mature enough to leave for a Holliday, let alone move away for university. They held me awake till 4 am under the guise of a family meeting, which was basically just a reprimanding session of all I had done wrong in my life.\n\nAnd to be honest... I was demoralized. I was ugly crying and feeling awful. Thankfully my boyfriend called because I had not answered several texts of his. He helped me transport all my stuff while my father was sleeping.And I left without telling him bye. He texted me around 1 pm and my father was acting like everything was normal.\n\nSo the two weeks passed very quickly. I got a mail that I got into a university that has a very good program for political science. So I accepted and put myself on the waiting list for University accommodation.\n\nThen shit blew up. My mother suddenly stopped giving my father half the money. So she was only paying what she was legally obligated to pay. My father was losing it. He began calling screaming at me to come home at once. Then calling me crying to tell me that the bitch of my mother had reappeared and was suing him (?) and now we did not have enough money to pay for the mortgage.\n\nI called my mother to ask if she was actually suing him. She said no and said that she had just gone through the courts to start paying me directly instead of my father, which was granted.Then my grandma started texting me. Saying I had to come home right away because my father had had a cardiac arrest.\n\nObviously, I went back home with my boyfriend. Only to find our house in literal shambles. There were beer cans, string liquor stuff, and cigarettes everywhere.\n\nEveryone that was betting that my father was using all the money on drugs and lavish stuff.... hey... congratulations... You were right.\n\nApparently when I left my father decided to have a huge party. He invited all these friends that he made in fancy bars. I know that because the lady that was in the hospital with my dad, his GF apparently. She did not know about me, she kept talking about our house as his \"summer residence\". I asked her a few questions. She answered. She is actually pretty sweet but put off by my father now that she knows how he lied.\n\nSo apparently my father would take the 3k and spend them almost fully on appearing to be richer. He had bought some clothing pieces that were high quality. He would hang out in these fancy hotel sky lounges where he met his GF. Then would take her and her friends out to expensive restaurants and clubs. She did not fully admit it but insinuated that they did coke often during those outings. Much like the party that leads my dad to OD. It was not only cocaine that they did. I also think an amphetamine?Anyway, I thanked her and told her that the money was not my father's and she had been lied to. She stayed till my father came to and we could bring him home. Which is when she dumped him.\n\nAnd then I broke it to him. I was leaving. He lost his shit. He punched me. He broke my nose. I was really afraid. He was not even fully recovered.\n\nIn the hospital, I told the nurse how it happened and the police got involved.\n\nMy mother took me in the very next day. She is helping me with all the legal things regarding my father. She helped me move out. Helped me move cities. it all happened very very fast. My boyfriend has been staying over because i am very afraid.\n\nMy father has been blocked but I have been getting threatening emails.So that is that. It is good and bad\n\nEDIT TO ANSWER FAQ:Why did my mother not take me in if my father was so abusive?I explained it already in the last posts. But Tldr. she had lost her rights due to her trying to commit suicide. It did not get better as my father and his friends in law enforcement and the judges in our small town are heavily biased toward against women.\n\nhow did you stumble upon so many documents so conveniently?I didn't. I very sought out those documents. I reached out to Mia myself and insisted in her showing me what she had. None of this was perchance. I have sought out every single document. They are available to the public. Plus if you know what you are looking for you will find them easily by going through your parents' files. This was not convenient. This was hard work\n\nIf you are 18 why is your mom still paying CS?Here you are legally entitled to CS and governmental CS till you finish University or/and till you reach your 25th birthday.\n\nAre you gonna sue your father for back payment?No. That would not be of any help. It would be extremely hard to prove that he blew it all. In the end, I was fed and clothed and I had a place to stay with heat, electricity and internet, and running water. It would take too long and not be good for anything but revenge. My mother is terrified of him and I am not keen on seeing him.\n\nWe are gonna pursue a restraining order and are documenting all his Mails and contact attempts. Someone pointed out to keep an eye out for my father opening accounts or credits in my name. We are looking into protecting ourselves in that area.Get a firearmNo. It is not legal nor makes any sense\n\nHow come your mother had a lawyer on retainer so conveniently?She didn't. My first post was well over a month ago. My mother reached out to a lawyer shortly after to transfer my CS from my father directly to me in a very clean-cut way. Since then that lawyer has recommended us to another firm that is taking my/ our case.Everything about school and University:\n\nI am not on a waiting list for what I am gonna study. I am on a waiting list for the dorm. Till then I am staying with my BF in a long-term Airbnb in the city.School starts in October, not next week. Again I DO NOT LIVE IN THE US.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Update post for you guys](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/y0izxm/update_post_for_you_guys/)10 October 2022, \n\nThe post was deleted but the publication was rescued in a comment\n\nI am Alex's Boyfriend.

He had brutally attacked me because I was going to leave him and the CS checks that he had been blowing on drugs and women, would stop with my departure.Last year my whole world crumbeled, when I found out that my mother had not left us. My father had abused her and made it impossible for her to take me.\n\nHe has made my life absolutley misserable. I have detailed this over the past few months here.After I was let out of the hospital, my mother and I got 2 amazing lawyers. One for the assault case and the other for the misappropriation of the money.\n\nThe process for the CS case was quick. He had to pack back 50% of the money given to him in the past 3 years to me directly. No further fines.However... the assault case spiraled. It was found out that he was going to attempt to plead not guilty in the case of temporary insanity. He had detailed his plan to get away with this to his gf. Who is not an awful human and showed the police what she had.\n\nSo it went from assault to attempted murder.\n\nWith his gf leaving him, him owing a bunch of money, looking at a hefty prison sentence, and no more money to bail himself out... he took his life on Friday.I was numb the whole week. But today the realization washed over me... I am finally free. I don't have to look over my shoulder, I don't flinch when I hear steps, I don't have anxiety while checking my phone.\n\nI am free.

Always. No matter if it's 5 mins up the road or catching a plane.\n\nBefore we get into it, no she isn't on the autism spectrum, she doesn't have ADHD or time blindness.\n\nShe just DAWDLES. ALL. THE TIME.\n\nShe snoozes her alarm at least three times every morning, then lays there going through her social media.\n\nEventually she gets up and takes a long ass shower, dresses (Which takes her forever, and she usually sits wrapped in a towel on her phone), then lingers over her coffee. 9 times out of 10 she's running late for work, and ends up speeding to make it on time.\n\nNaturally, she's gotten a number of speeding tickets. I've tried to help her - eg putting her phone where she can't reach it from bed so she has to get up to snooze it, but she literally just grabs it and goes back to bed.\n\nYou try to get her to move her ass and she just digs in her heels and takes even longer. Her response to people calling out her lateness is \"better late than dead on time\".\n\nAnyway, again, she was running even later than normal for work, and really had to speed to make it. A week goes by and sure enough, massive speeding fine in the mail.\n\nShe now has to hand in her drivers license because she's got so many demerit points, she'll be without one for 6 months.\n\nInstead of just dealing with it, she TELLS me \"I'll need you to cop this one and say you were driving so I don't lose my license\" and of course, I refused, telling her she needs to live with the consequences of her actions and maybe she should stop speeding, and wake up earlier.\n\nThis argument went on for a few days until she finally conceded, then proceeds to tell me \"well, you'll have to drive me to and from work until I get my license back\", and I tell her I won't be doing that - her work is literally in another direction than my work is from home, and doing so would add another two hours of driving per day. She says it shouldn't matter as my work has flexible hours, but I stood my ground and refused, and said she can take public transport - there's literally a bus stop 2 mins walk from our house and the bus stops maybe 5 mins walk from her work, and it's quite regular,\n\nShe says she hates public transport and refuses to ride it, so I said then it's Uber for her, or organise a car pool, but bottom line, it's not my responsibility.\n\nShe called me an AH and is giving me the silent treatment, said a decent boyfriend would go to those lengths for her and that it's only 6 months.\n\nSo, am I AH for not \"saving her license\" and refusing to drive her to and from work for 6 months?\n\nTL,DR: Gf is always running late, speeds to work, gets caught, loses license, expects me to cop the blame so she can keep her license, I Refuse, she then expects me to drive her to and from work but it's literally out of my way, says I'm the AH.\n\nEDIT: We live in Brisbane, Australia for those wondering\n\n***OOP is voted NTA***\n\n**Update 1 in** [Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xln17/aita_for_not_saving_my_gfs_drivers_license_and/k36wnpu/?context=3)**: October 2, 2023 (Next Day)**\n\nADD: Wow!

Having personally heard of a few recent cases of Londoners getting bedbugs after staying in student accomodation, AirBnB's or cheap hotels like Travelodge, I thought it might be handy to do a thread on bedbug signs to look out for and how to avoid them.\n\n**Size:** Adult bedbugs are typically 5-7mm long (which is about the same size as an apple seed) but start off life only 1mm long, which is the same size as their small, white eggs.\n\n**Appearance:** Bedbugs change in both size, shape and colour not just over the course of their lives but also depending on whether they had fed recently, a while ago or a very long time ago. This image [https://www.pestworld.org/media/562756/bed-bugs-on-quarter.jpg](https://www.pestworld.org/media/562756/bed-bugs-on-quarter.jpg) shows the changes over their lives (plus fed VS unfed) and this image [https://citybugs.tamu.edu/files/2010/12/bed-bug-feeding-Whitney-Cranshawb.jpg](https://citybugs.tamu.edu/files/2010/12/bed-bug-feeding-Whitney-Cranshawb.jpg) shows how much a bedbug can change in shape and overall appearance over the course of a single feed.\n\nSigns of bedbugs:\n\n**Gaps:** Bedbugs are primarily nocturnal animals and during the day they will retreat into tiny cracks and crevices (which is where they also lay their eggs in), living in colonies, meaning that you don't typically see them scuttling around during the day. Favourite bedbug hiding spots often include seams in mattresses (classic example: [https://i.pinimg.com/originals/af/0a/46/af0a46df679d7b121ecaca7053997ff1.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/af/0a/46/af0a46df679d7b121ecaca7053997ff1.jpg) ), in-between the joins in bedframes or other furniture and inside splits or holes in wood (classic example: [https://u2y4v6x2.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Can-Bed-Bugs-Live-In-Wood-Furniture.jpg](https://u2y4v6x2.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Can-Bed-Bugs-Live-In-Wood-Furniture.jpg) ).\n\n**Patches:** Bedbugs diet of blood causes their faeces to stain soft &amp; hard furnishings with small black or dark brown splotches. Because bedbugs are very good at hiding, their existence is more often evidenced by these markings than by the actual bugs themselves, here is a classic example of bedbug faecal splotches on wood [https://anchorpestcontrol.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/How-to-Get-Rid-of-Bed-Bugs-and-Keep-Them-Out-2.png](https://anchorpestcontrol.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/How-to-Get-Rid-of-Bed-Bugs-and-Keep-Them-Out-2.png) and here is an example of what their markings look like on a mattress [https://www.planetnatural.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/early-signs-of-bed-bugs.png](https://www.planetnatural.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/early-signs-of-bed-bugs.png)\n\n**Smells:** Bedbugs and their infestations are also associated with certain smells because the animals signal to each other via pheromones which to the human nose often either smell like coriander or raspberries, so much so that in olden times bedbugs used to be called the *\"Coriander Bug\"*. When a full-blown bedbug infestation is in swing you will often smell either a strange musty berry-like sweet smell emanating from the room, a smell of coriander or an acrid almond-like smell (they can also make rooms smell like old bed linen in general).\n\n**Skins:** Bedbugs repeatedly shed their old skins as they grow larger and develop into adults. Finding evidence of light brown, translucent skins like these [https://njaes.rutgers.edu/bed-bug/images/Shed-skins-big.jpg](https://njaes.rutgers.edu/bed-bug/images/Shed-skins-big.jpg) is another common sign that a place has an infestation.\n\n**Blood:** Bedbugs typically only feed on people at night while they are asleep and then retreat before sunrise. They go for any exposed skin they can find and if you have been so unfortunate to sleep in a bed that has bugs then you might see small specks or splotches of red or dried blood on the sheets the next day like this: [https://bonaccordpestcontrol.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Signs-of-bed-bugs-red-bloodstains-on-sheets-1.jpg](https://bonaccordpestcontrol.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Signs-of-bed-bugs-red-bloodstains-on-sheets-1.jpg)\n\n**Bite Marks:** Bedbugs will typically bite in close patterns like this: [https://health.clevelandclinic.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/04/bedbugBites-656515070-770x553-2.jpg](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/04/bedbugBites-656515070-770x553-2.jpg) ) and the bites often display as larger than mosquito bites but unlike mosquito bites they don't always itch (and sometimes present as hive-like markings these: [https://cdn-prod.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/articles/318/318083/line-of-bedbug-bites-on-a-woman-s-back.jpg](https://cdn-prod.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/articles/318/318083/line-of-bedbug-bites-on-a-woman-s-back.jpg) ).\n\nOther signs of infestation:\n\n**Fumigation chemical smells:** We are experiencing bedbug problems because years of laws that reduced the arsenal of highly toxic (but also highly effective) pesticide chemicals meant that over time bedbug treatments became less effective and as bedbugs began to survive treatments, they evolved greater resistance to chemicals. This also means that if a place has been recently fumigated it might not be bedbug-free yet (in fact sometimes places are taking up to 2-3 treatments before they are completely free).  Although *Sulfuryl Fluoride* (the main ingredient in fumigation chemicals) is odorless, *Chloropicrin* (which smells sweet and is very acrid &amp; harsh to inhale) is added to fumigation mixes to help warn people from entering places that have been recently fumigated. If you suspect that you smell any lingering fumigation smells or see a place being fumigated, it is wise to avoid the whole site as treatments are not always proving effective against bedbug infestations.\n\nHow bedbugs transmit:\n\n**Luggage:** Unlike headlice or bodylice, bedbugs do not live on people's bodies. Instead, the most common way they get from one place to another is by hiding in the seams or gaps in or on people's luggage.\n\n**Clothing:** Bedbugs can also hide inbetween stacks of clothing inside people's luggage.\n\nSo, to round up, your plan of action when staying anywhere unfamiliar should be:\n\n1. **Smell:** Before you put your luggage down, smell the room: Does it smell like coriander, chemicals, old bed linen, musty raspberries or acrid almonds? If so, there could be bedbugs.\n2. **Mattress:** Check the mattress by lifting up the bed sheets and checking along the seams of the mattress for signs of bedbugs and their distinctive faecal patches.\n3. **Bedrame:** Check the bedframe by looking along the joins of the bedframe, behind the headboard and inside any cracks or splits in the wood for signs of bedbugs and their distinctive faecal patches.\n4. **Luggage:** Keep your luggage closed at night and ideally opt for hard-cased luggage bags over soft luggage bags.\n5. **Clothes:** Keep your clothes inside of re-sealable plastic bags.\n6. **Torch:** Pack a small flashlight in your luggage to make checking your room for bedbugs easier.\n7. **Floor:** Don't store your luggage on a carpeted floor, instead opt to store it on a smooth, flat raised surface.\n8. **Checks:** Before you leave your stay, take your luggage into the bathroom (where it is bright &amp; light), shake it out in the bath or shower area and inspect things like the pockets &amp; straps to make sure that no critters have hitched a ride. If you have access to a vacuum hoover, give the luggage a quick going over before you take it with you.\n9. **Ineffective:** Over-the-counter insect repellant sprays and insect killer sprays like Raid are all ineffective in strength against bedbugs and so inadvisable to spray on your luggage, self or clothes, which will unnecessarily expose you to toxic chemicals.\n10. **Home:** Once you get home, keep all your holiday clothes sealed in bags until they have all been washed &amp; laundered with detergents and vacuum hoover the luggage cases.\n11. **Scents:** Bedbugs are reported to not like the smells emitted by natural lavendar, citris fruits, cinnamon &amp; mint, so some people believe that if you make your luggage smell of these scents then it might help to deter bedbugs from hitching a ride on it.\n\nIf you suspect even the slightest bit that your room might have bedbugs in it, inform the manager straightaway and demand a new room; a hotel has absolutely no right to force you to sleep in or pay for any rooms which have bedbugs in them.\n\nThe strange behaviours of Paris's bedbugs:\n\n1. **Unusual places:** Bedbugs always used to be associated with bedrooms and luggage but in recent years there have been increasing reports of people seeing bedbugs in places such as cinema's and on public transport like the Metro systems carriage seats [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPjbn7DuWGY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPjbn7DuWGY)\n2. **No longer strictly nocturnal:** There have also been increasing reports of people witnessing bedbugs actively scuttling around during the daytime.\n\nSo it is advisable to not just exercise caution when staying in places like AirBnB's, hotels, student accomodation and hostels, but also in other public places that have soft furnishings such as seats on buses, trains, cinema's and tube carriages.\n\n*Edit: spelling*\n\n&amp;#x200B;","subreddit":"london","comments":722,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/16znhzx/frances_bedbug_epidemic_coming_to_london_and_how/"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-24","timestamp":1695583161,"title":"Awesome advice!","text":"","subreddit":"WhitePeopleTwitter","comments":116,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/16r65cu/awesome_advice/"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-19","timestamp":1695096006,"title":"AITA for refusing to let my parents put a tracker on my (28F) phone?","text":"**I am NOT the Original Poster.

My (28F) life has not turned out the way I wanted it to. I still live at home with my parents, who are extremely controlling.\n\nAll my friends have left the country and so I'm on my own a lot. Most of my time is spent at home, at work or going on solo walks. I don't drink. I don't go to the gym or play sports anymore. I don't have hobbies outside the house. I haven't dated anyone for 7 years. All and all a very uninteresting life. My one solace is being outdoors in nature and walking.\n\nMy parents aren't happy with this. They think women shouldn't go on walks by themselves as it is dangerous (in their words). I know it would be better to ease their concerns if I had someone to go on walks with but I don't.\n\nMy mum has been trying to get me to put \"Share My Location\" on my phone with her for years. I understand that she worries about my safety. However, the big problem for me is I know it is not just about my safety. She'll use it to become my stalker. I know this because she has my Dad share his location with her and visa versa. She sits and stares at her screen and will say things like \"Oh your father has just left tennis\", \"Oh your father has just arrived at work\", \"Oh your father is leaving the pub\". Not that I've anything to hide, but it is the one boundary I've held on to and I have been so proud of myself for not caving.\n\nToday's Events.\n\nToday I decided that I'd take a trip up the coast and go for a walk along the sea. I told my parents about my plans (10:30am). My mum asked that I call her and keep in touch. Once I got there (2 pm), I called her and told her where I was. I also told her what walk and route I would be taking. I didn't tell her when I would be home (but she also didn't ask). I also didn't message to say I was on my way home.\n\nMy parents were furious when I arrived back (8pm). My dad told my that I no longer had a say and that it was mandatory for me to have a tracker on my phone. I told him that I had done everything asked of me: I had called, explained where I was going etc. I also said they could have called me if they were concerned about my whereabouts.\n\nSo as a result, I've been punished. The car that I drive is technically my dad's and so he has taken the keys away. He says that I can buy my own car or grant them access to my tracking information.They said they would never do this to me, hold the fact they bought the car over my head. Also, it makes no sense for me to buy a new car now. I'm at the final stage of a graduate recruitment process and if I am successful, I will be moving to London in September. However, I need to survive between now and then and without a car the little life I have is impossible.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let them put a tracker on my phone when their concern is my safety?\n\nEdit: My dad hasn't told me that he has taken the keys. I've a work event today (day after post) and he plans for me to not find them when I need to go.\n\n***Relevant Comments:***\n\n*Your parents are incredibly toxic, but you may need to put up with this until you can get out:*\n\n\"I am in my bedroom with my door closed and my dad just walked past and said \"stupid bitch\" at my door. Trying not to cry that my wonderful day has been ruined. It does feel toxic.\"\n\n*Can you take public transport?*\n\n\"Yes I can but the public transport system here is not very good. My work is a 10 minute drive away but via public transport it would take me an hour. I do work from home most days though so that is something. I could also go to parks that are within walking distance for some outdoors.\"\n\n*Do you pay to live there?*\n\n\"I only pay a nominal amount of £200 a month as per my dad's request. I do feel guilty about it as I know people normally give a lot more than that.\"\n\n*Does your dad know your mom stalks him?*\n\n\"Yes, he does and doesn't seem to mind.\"\n\n*Do they pay for your phone?*\n\n\"They don't pay for my phone! Though the car is theirs. Unfortunately the car I bought had an engine failure. I just couldn't afford to buy another car so this was the comprimise solution. I had actually been considering asking to buy the car from them but it now seems silly, especially with the London move potentially happening and this drama.\"\n\n***OOP is voted NTA, with many people offering resources and tools for her to get out***\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16h5wz8/update_aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_parents_put_a/)**: September 12, 2023 (3 months later)**\n\nHi everyone! Quick update for anyone who is interested.\n\nRecap: My parents wanted to put a tracker on my (28F) phone \"for my safety\". I said no and was called a stupid bitch. Drama ensued. Original post [here](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/GiPGFE6Yfh).\n\nUpdate: Things were very frosty the next couple of days. My Mum eventually came to me and said that she was going to address the \"elephant in the room\". She said that she was very disappointed in me but, as I didn't care about her, she will just have to live without it (the tracker on my phone). I think she expected me to cave at that point but I didn't. I said \"thank you for understanding\" and that was it. The car keys were returned to the drawer and nothing more was said about it from anyone (including my Dad). To this day, I have no idea why the 180 degree flip happened.\n\nAlthough you all helped me realise that I have an unhealthy codependant relationship with my parents, I think it will just take time to set boundaries and learn how to be my own person. I still love them a lot and I know they love me too (even though we aren't the type of family that says so).\n\nWhich leads me to my other news...I got the job in London! I have officially moved out and am living there now. It still feels surreal. I know it is going to take some time to get used to living independently but I am ready to be my own person and learn how to do things on my own. Honestly, I had given up hope that this day would ever come. I feel so much happier and can genuinely say I am proud of myself. If anyone has any tips for living away from home for the first time, please let me know!\n\nFinally, thank you for all your support and giving me the push I needed. I was in a very dark place and now feel like I can start living my life. Thank you.\n\nSmall Edit: People are asking about the car / asking me to check it for trackers. To clarify, I didn't bring the car with me so can't check it. Probably for the best.\n\n***Relevant Comments:***\n\n*Put your parents on an information diet:*\n\n\"So I am struggling with the \"information diet\" thing. I am so used to calling my mum multiple times a day about anything and everything. It feels like it is a habit and weird not to call them. So that's on me. I need to learn to be able to go longer without talking to them and not telling them everything about everything. But I am finding that hard right now.\"\n\n*That 180 degree flip probably happened because you stood your ground:*\n\n\"Thank you! It was really hard to stand my ground. I do think that this is what happened, not that they put a tracker elsewhere as they aren't that tech savy (especially my mum lols).\"\n\n*You said you have a codependent relationship with your parents, but don't downplay their toxicity. They're manipulative and weren't treating you well:*\n\n\"It does look bad when written out like this tbh.

She divorced my dad (60) when I was 7 and almost immediately married my stepfather \"Mark\" whom despite everything, I was close with. They remained married until I was 16. I was upset when she divorced him and went to live with my dad and stepmom. In my adult life, I've chosen to remain close to my stepdad and even attended his wedding to his current wife, who is a very nice woman. My dad and my stepmom are great people.\n\nSince her divorce to my stepdad, my mom has been in and out of relationships, each time claiming this guy is the love of her life until they do something she doesn't like and they aren't the love of her life anymore. Both divorces with my dad and my stepdad were for very petty reasons (dad, I think because he wouldn't allow her to get a new car because the budget was tight). I think the one that lasted the longest was 6 years and I think it's the current guy she's with, according to my sister. After I left home, she never did anything with me without her boyfriends. When I was 25, she broke up with her boyfriend and tried to cry to me about it. After working with my therapist, I set the boundary with my mother that if she wasn't willing to do anything with me without her boyfriend to not bother and I didn't want to talk about her love life. She was very hurt and we fell out for awhile but she came back around about a year later and has respected my rule since but we only get together about 3 or 4 times per year. I understand that my mom's relationships and love life are important to her so I respect that we don't get together often.\n\nFast forward to this year, I'm getting married to my partner (35M) of a decade in October. It's a small intimate backyard wedding and reception/bbq. We live in a rural area and our backyard wedding will have roughly 40 people. My dad, stepmom, stepdad and his new wife have all been invited. My mom asked if she could bring her boyfriend, I said no because I don't know him. My mom asked if she could bring him to meet me so I could meet him before the wedding. I said no and that I still had no interest in meeting her boyfriends. She said she understood but she felt it was unfair that I wasn't allowing her a +1 to my wedding when my dad and my stepdad were allowed to bring their spouses. I told her that the difference was that I knew their spouses. She wanted to know why I was so adamant about refusing to get to know her boyfriend. I explained to her that I saw no need since she'd just break up with them and move on to someone else eventually as she has always done before. She started to cry and told me I was being unreasonable and treating her as if she's a wh**e.\n\nBoth my fiance and my sister feel like I should suck it up for one day and let her bring her boyfriend so she can be comfortable there. I'm seriously considering it but I wanted to know if I'm TA here for sticking to my boundary at my wedding and what your thoughts are.\n\nUPDATE: After reading everything here, I've decided to email my mother and invite him. I was already leaning towards telling her that he can come when I posted. I decided to set some ground rules for my mother:\n\n1. He is there as a +1 to my mother only. I made it clear to her that he is not my family and he is not my stepfather so I will appreciate her not telling other people at the wedding he is my stepfather. Mark is my stepfather and he will be there.\n\n2. He is not to be in any family photos (in fairness, my stepdad Mark won't be in any family photos either, only my mom, dad, stepmom, and my siblings).\n\n3. He is not to approach me at any point during the wedding and reception.\n\n4. This does not change my previous boundaries. I'm only allowing him to come for her own comfort and to create a sense of fairness. I respect the fact she is in a relationship but that her love life has nothing to do with me and I wish to keep it that way.\n\n5. I told my mother that these are my terms for him being at my wedding and my terms are final and that I hope she can respect the fact that I'm trying to be reasonable. I used this opportunity to remind her the reasons I put the boundary up in the first place. These reasons included forcing me to do activities with her shorter term boyfriends in the past, forcing me to only discuss her love life while showing no interest in my life, and putting her relationships above her own children.\n\nIf she responds, I'll let everyone know.\n\nUpdate 2: My mom called me within 10 minutes of getting the email. She thanked me for allowing him to come and said they would abide by my terms. She said she felt really hurt that during her actions during her \"mid-life crisis\" are why I'm refusing to meet her current boyfriend (who she says she's been with for 7.5 years) and that she thought things would eventually calm down enough where I would be comfortable meeting him. She said she now realizes that it will never happen. I told her that I'm firm on my stance. I think she started to cry but she said she understood and only wants him there because being around my dad and stepdad and their \"new\" wives (my dad has been married for 23 years and my stepdad for 12) makes her anxious and he helps keep her calm. She said she respects my stance and said it's her own fault I feel this way. I felt this may be the start of a guilt trip so I politely ended the call.\n\n**VERDICT: NOT THE ASSHOLE**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Additional comments to the post from OOP:**\n\n&gt;**OP:** \n&gt;Update: I will update here since mods told me I was maxed on my post.\n&gt;\n&gt;I want to thank everyone here for commenting and giving their opinions. Without context, I think it's a little hard to understand why I'm the way I am towards my mother. This past has given me a chance to reflect on my own behavior towards my mother. The truth of it is, I find dealing with her to be exhausting and I want to explain to everyone why.\n&gt;\n&gt;1) My mom is a gold digger. And that isn't my dad or stepdad talking shit about my mom. They're classy guys and would never do that. This is my own conclusion. My mom said regarding both divorces \"I'd still be married if [dad or stepdad] just gave me what I wanted.\" She's also tried to start fights with my stepmom because she realizes my brother and I prefer her over our actual mom. It's true, I'm closer with my stepmom. I go to her for all the mom things because she listens and cares. My stepmom doesn't make every thing about her. I believe my mom suffers from main character syndrome and expects to be the center of attention at every event and if she isn't, she gets drunk which leads me to my next point...\n&gt;\n&gt;2) My mom is an alcoholic. She was in a DUI 8 years ago and crashed into another car. Thank goodness no one was hurt. She doesn't drive anymore, lives in the city an hour away, and uses public transportation. But she still drinks a lot, at her height, she drank roughly 3 bottles of wine per day. I don't really know or care if it's more or less now. One of the other boundaries I set is I won't be around her if she's been drinking because that just stresses me out more. I'll be honest, I'm anticipating she's going to cause a drunken scene at my wedding.\n&gt;\n&gt;3) She slept with my brother's best friend 8 years ago when they were 21. This was a boy who my brother had known since pre-school and this ruined the friendship. 8 years on and my brother will never forgive her for it. My mom thinks my brother needs to get over himself and that she did nothing wrong. Technically speaking, she didn't do anything illegal and everyone was a consenting adult but it still felt so wrong that she slept with someone my brother was so close with. It's why I don't really want my partner around her. She dates younger guys. This current boyfriend is 10 years younger than her, which is a little better. I don't judge her for dating younger guys, that's okay. It's not okay to sleep with someone you watched grow up.\n&gt;\n&gt;This whole post helped me see just how exhausted I am by her. I realized I don't want to deal with her BS anymore. I also agree that I have maybe at times shown it by being TA and being unfair and unreasonable towards her. I just don't like myself when dealing with her. It puts me in a bad mood. However, the idea of having her more in my life makes me nauseous but I want to keep the peace with the larger family (grandparents, aunt, uncle, etc.). I've decided to take a page from my youngest brother's book and keep contact to just family functions. He's cordial to her at family events and keeps the peace when he's around her but he keeps his distance and won't see her outside of a family event. So I'm going to do the same. I realized she could get sober, go to therapy, and change her entire life around but I'm still going to see the woman who drinks all the time, sleeps with my brother's friend and just treats people like garbage. It's not fair to anyone; not me for having dealt with her, and not her if she ever did or was actively working hard to change her life. I do want to make sure she's taken care of, fine, and healthy but I also want to not be emotionally involved anymore. Figuring that out is above Reddit's paygrade.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Relevant Comments from OOP:**\n\n***Resident_Test_2107:** Honestly I think you need to distinguish the hurt you felt as a kid when she broke up with your 2 father figures from what would happen now if they broke up. You are an adult, not a kid. Her break ups are her business, and don\u0019t impact you directly. Expecting someone to come to a wedding with her two exes there with their new wives is ALOT. Expecting her to suck it up to put you first feels like you are trying to play out some drama and feelings you have left over from feeling hurt/abandoned as a kid by her breaking up your home. Divorce happens, it sucks for the kids but so does an unhappy marriage. Feels like time to go back to therapy*\n\n&gt;**OP:** In my early 20s, she used to call me whenever she had a breakup and expected my sister and me to be emotionally supportive. She wouldn't spend time with me without her bfs around. She was insisting I meet some guy (who typically is a lot younger than her, like late 20s, or early 30s which good on her but still weird for me) she was dating for a few weeks. They'd break up after a year and she'd immediately find someone new. Wash. Rinse. Repeat. This was the pattern from when I was 19-25. I always had to spend time with both of them. All she would talk about is her relationship. She would never ask me about school, my job or my relationship. She's only met my partner twice. There's a lot more I can add about how my mom constantly prioritized her relationships over being a parent but they aren't pertinent to this story.\n&gt;\n&gt;She got with a really toxic guy when I was 24 who stole a bunch of money from her. We all warned her he was a scumbag but she didn't listen. After that, I told her I wanted nothing to do with her boyfriends going forward. She got really mad saying I was disrespectful and that any child should want to see her mother happy. But I just got tired of dealing with her relationship drama and I don't ever want to deal with it again. I'm sure the guy she's with is nice since he's been around this long but I'm just done.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[**I don't want to be around my mother but I want to be around family**](https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/163omu4/i_dont_want_to_be_around_my_mother_but_i_want_to/) - **August 28, 2023 (Five days later)**\n\nI posted last week in r/AmItheAsshole and I got some personal messages telling me I should check out this forum.\n\nI've decided to estrange myself from my mother. We haven't gotten along since I was 16 and the last several years have been really bad. We only get together about 2-4 times per year and it always ends with us fighting. I'm tired of it. I'll be honest. I've considered many times cutting contact with her but the one thing that's preventing me from fully severing ties is her parents - my grandparents. I love them very much and they are still hurting from my brother choosing to sever ties with her and keeping in low contact with that side of the family. My brother had valid reasons for doing this to her and he will get together with my grandparents if my mother isn't there but it's hard because they want to see him at the holidays and during special moments. I'm getting married in Oct and this will be the 1st event where my mom and brother are in the same area (I've told both of them to stay away from each other but I'm anticipating there will be drama because my mom doesn't like to hear she can't do something).\n\nI want to make it so we can see each other and be cordial at family events but not hang out otherwise. My youngest brother does something similar. I don't want to write her a letter because I fear that will cause more drama but I expect she'll eventually call and want to do something with me but I want to say no unless it's at a larger family function.\n\nHow should I do this?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[**My mother thinks she's entitled to alcohol at my wedding**](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/16qavjn/my_mother_thinks_shes_entitled_to_alcohol_at_my/) - **September 23, 2023 (A month later)**\n\nMy fiance (35M) and I 33(NB) are getting married in two weeks in our backyard. We will be having a catering spead for our reception afterwards. We decided to have a dry wedding for two reasons: my mom is an alcoholic who is known for making a scene when she gets drunk and my fiance has a brother who binge drinks and has had alcohol poisoning on more than one occasion (he doesn't drink all the time but if he starts he can't stop until he either passes out or someone physically restrains him from getting more). I also have an Uncle (mom's brother) and a stepdad who are in recovery and don't need the temptation. Neither fiance and I are big drinkers so we decided to just avoid any problems and just have a dry wedding. We will will have a less dry reception party/honeymoon with some our friends later on. All of our families have been supportive, my uncle was especially grateful to us for doing this since he takes his recovery very seriously and has been 7 years sober. I sent out wedding invitations 4 months ago and said it would be a dry wedding and asked people not to bring alcohol.\n\nNow today I get this call from my mom, who I also sent an invitation to 4 months ago:\n\nMom: Is it true you're not having alcohol at your wedding?\n\nMe: Yes. Fiance and I decided we didn't want alcohol during our special time.\n\nMom: That's so silly. It's going to make your wedding boring.\n\nMe: Well, I'm sorry you feel that way but [fiance] and I have made our decision. We want everyone to feel comfortable at our wedding.\n\nMom: Clearly, you don't care about my comfort! What if I want to have a little drink to pass the time?\n\nMe: Like you did at [A different Uncle]'s wedding where you got so drunk and made a horrible scene calling [Uncle]'s wife a golddigger?\n\nMom: It wasn't my fault! They made the drinks there too strong.\n\nMe: Right...I really wish you would address this need to have alcohol wherever you go.\n\nMom: I don't NEED to have alcohol. I just think your wedding will be boring without it. You want to have a fun wedding, don't you?\n\nMe: It will be a fun wedding. We don't need alcohol to have fun.\n\nMom: This is so stupid. Why should everyone else be punished just to make it comfortable for a few people? It seems like you care more about [Uncle] and [Stepdad] than anyone else.\n\nMe: Or maybe I just want to avoid any scenes.\n\nMom: I JUST TOLD YOU, THAT WASN'T MY FAULT!\n\nMe: Just like your DUI isn't your fault?\n\nMom: How DARE you bring up that difficult time in my life. I was going through a lot emotionally. What the hell is wrong with you kids?! You need to mind your own business. If I want to drink, that's my business!\n\nMe: Well my wedding is my business. We do not want alcohol there. That's final. I can't stop you if you decide to pre-game my wedding but I've already made it clear to [uncles and brothers] that if you cause a scene, that you are to be made to leave.\n\nMom (starts crying): Why do you kids hate me so much? What did I ever do to deserve to be treated like this by my children?\n\nMe: Are you really ready for me to go down that list?\n\nMom: None of you understand! None of you will ever understand! I'm the mother of the bride, I should be treated better than this.\n\nMe: I think I've treated you pretty well during this process. I've acquiesced to your boyfriend whom I don't even know coming to my wedding. I've even given in to some of your other demands. So please tell me how you've been mistreated?\n\nMom: You didn't invite me to go dress shopping! The mother of the bride always goes dress shopping with her daughter. I barely know [fiance] because you never bring him around me. How do I know that you're marrying the right person?\n\nMe: That's because [Aunt] made my dress.\n\nMom (sarcastically): Well isn't that just special...\n\nMe (sighing): As for the rest, I think you know why. We aren't really close enough for you to have any say in who my significant other is. Honestly mom, I'm done with this conversation. If you really feel that strongly about this, I'll understand if you don't want to attend my wedding.\n\nMom: OH I bet you'd like that wouldn't you? One way or another you will respect me as your mother!\n\nMe: Sure, mom. I'm hanging up now. Bye.\n\nGuys, I'm so livid right now. I have half a mind to uninvite her. I spoke to my dad and her brother. My uncle thinks her drinking is getting really bad again and has been wanting to hold an intervention. I told him I'm focused on the wedding right now but that I definitely agree this was out of line and something needs to be done.\n\nWhat do I do? I don't want her ruining my wedding but I'm so tired of dealing with this. Sorry this is probably above Reddit's pay grade but I just needed to vent.\n\nUpdate: I sent a text reiterating the rules. She said she knows where she isn't welcome and said she won't attend. My dad told me not to worry about this anymore and that he'll see to it she doesn't ruin my wedding.\n\nUpdate 2: I sent this text to my mom:\n\nMother, At this point I'm going to officially uninvite you from my wedding. I'm not going to allow you to change your mind and I'd prefer it if you not come to my wedding at all given your poor behavior. At this point, I've decided I don't want any further contact with you unless you decide to curb your toxic behaviors and drinking. I wish you the best, I hope you can find a way to heal but I can't do this anymore. I'm sorry if this hurts you but I can't handle you in my life anymore. If you try to force the issue, I'll be forced to take legal action up to and including contacting law enforcement. Please don't contact me again.\n\nI went to delete her from my Facebook page only to find a post that she had just written saying how being a mother is a thankless job and how she doesn't understand how she raised rude and judgemental kids. She ended it by saying she hopes her kids get over themselves someday. I'm done. This sucks but it's been a long time coming. My head hurts.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Relevant Comments from OOP:**\n\n***HawthorneUK:** I'd lay down the law with her, and uninvite her if she won't accept that she needs to be sober while she's there.*\n\n*Have somebody who is willing and able to eject her if (when) she sneaks alcohol in and gets drunk anyway.*\n\n&gt;**OP:** That's what I'm thinking. Her own brothers are saying they will eject her if she even causes a scene. My youngest uncle (whose wedding she ruined by causing a scene) made me a vow that he will not allow what happened at his wedding to happen at mine.\n&gt;\n&gt;My brothers (her own kids) despise her so they said if she even breathes wrong they will make sure she leaves.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n***One_Strain_2531:** Honestly best bet is pack a suitcase of her stuff and drive her to a rehab place. She clearly has a drinking problem and tries to gaslight others into believing she doesn't have a problem. If she doesn't get better in or after rehab then you might have to go low or no contact with her. Sorry*\n\n&gt;**OP:** She had to spend a year in rehab due to her DUI and the property damage she caused. It had no effect. I've decided to cut her from my life.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n[**Small update**](https://www.reddit.com/user/throwaway4meeeeeee86/comments/16r0vet/small_update/) - **September 24, 2023 (One day later)**\n\nFirstly, I want to thank everyone for the support. You have no idea how much your love and constructive comments mean to me. I'm glad I'm not alone.\n\nIt's not a huge update. But I guess my grandparents and uncles have had enough. They've decided to stage an intervention next weekend. If she refuses to get help, she will no longer be welcomed at family events and she will no longer be part of the family. They told me not to worry about it. My sister will go as she's the only one of her children that even has a real relationship with her but even my sister said that if she doesn't get help, she will cut her off too. I'm hoping and praying this works but given that she spent 1 year in rehab and the second she was off probation chose to drink again doesn't give me a lot of hope.\n\nMy dad told me he's hiring the local biker gang to act as security. We live in a small town and the nearest big city is about an hour away so it would really expensive to have a security company come out. I don't have a problem with that. This is the type of gang that helps out abused kids and animals and they do a lot of good where I live. The worst I've heard about them is they doled out some rural justice to a guy that was beating up the sister of one of the members and ran him out of town. When my mom got her DUI, she ran into someone's house and car (when she tried to back out, no one was hurt, thank goodness) and I guess it was the house of a relation of someone in the gang so they agreed to help and my dad is paying them to be security just in case. They know my family (one of my dad's cousins is a member) and they know my mom (I think she dated a guy in the gang at one point) and what to look out for. It may be moot if she ends up in rehab.\n\nI'm not stressing about her anymore. I have 13 days until my wedding. I'm going to focus on the final touches and just enjoy myself. My biological mom made her choices. Now that I've stood up for myself, I feel nothing but relief. My stepmom will be there and I see her more as my \"real\" mom so it's all fine. I've been through a lot of therapy already so I've had to make peace with how my actual mother is.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[**I'm officially estranged from my mother**](https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/16r170y/im_officially_estranged_from_my_mother/) - **September 24, 2023 (Same day, fifteen minutes later on a different sub from \"Small Update\")** \n\nWell it happened yesterday. I got into a fight with my mother and officially estranged myself from her. It sucks and I had a gnarly headache when I was done. Her drinking and behavior just proved too much and I had to univite her from my wedding.\n\nI feel sad it came to this but the most powerful feeling I have is relief.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[**Update: My mother thinks she's entitled to alcohol at my wedding**](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/16wdimk/update_my_mother_thinks_shes_entitled_to_alcohol/) - **September 30, 2023 (Six days later)**\n\nI didn't think I'd be back so soon, but it's my mom's world and we all just live in it.\n\nMy mother got 911 called on her for domestic violence on Tuesday. She apparently started throwing wine bottles at her boyfriend who locked himself in the bathroom and called the cops while she destroyed their place in one of her temper tantrums. She wasn't making any sense when the cops got there so they restrained her and took her to a hospital. She's been stuck in the psychiatric ward ever since. My sister was listed as a contact for her and she got the call about mom on Wednesday. The doctors at the hospital spoke to my sister and they think she may be showing signs of alcohol related dementia and some sort of psychotic disorder like bipolar disorder. They currently have her in alcohol detox and from what my sister was told, it's pretty bad. They won't allow her visitors until she's out of detox, not that anyone really has a desire to visit her anymore.\n\nMy sister and I decided enough was enough and we've petitioned a guardianship for her yesterday at the request of a social worker who interviewed my sister, my uncles, my grandparents, and myself. A guardianship means they can hold her while it winds through the system rather than her being released after 72 hours. My grandmother's upset as she thinks all of the issues should be kept in the family and the state shouldn't step in. My uncles and grandfather are on the side of having a guardianship. As far as they're concerned, she's not welcome in the family anymore and they won't allow her to continue to take advantage of anyone in the family anymore. My sister and I say let her be a professional's problem and let them figure out what to do with her. My brothers don't care and have effectively washed their hands of her years ago so their stance is whatever keeps her as far away as humanly possible. We can't deal with her anymore and why should we? With the guardianship petitioned, I'm working on washing my hands of this situation entirely. I'm sure I'll be interviewed about why a guardianship is necessary but other than that, I don't plan to have any further contact with my mom unless she apologizes and makes amends for her behavior, if that's something she's even capable of anymore. I just don't see that happening and any compassion or understanding I had for her in the past is gone. Whatever state her life is in, she brought it on herself. I just want to move on with my life without her in it and be done with her for good.\n\nIt doesn't look like she'll be released from the hospital any time soon so there's no risk of her attending my wedding. I did talk to her boyfriend yesterday after sister and I filed our paperwork and we decided to invite him to lunch. He's decided to break up with her for good and we learned just how bad things were with her. He's a real nice guy who's been caught up in a bad situation and had no clue how bad she could be. I feel really bad for him. I did decide to invite him to my wedding as I can tell he's a lonely dude who's been to hell and back. Not sure he'll show but the offer is there.\n\nThere was a time I'd have allowed an event like this to ruin the run up to the wedding but I've been able to separate my mom's behavior from the wedding. It hasn't put a damper on it. Now that my mom is squared away, I can enjoy myself. I just put the final touches on the catering order and am expecting the last of my supplies. My aunt wants to put the final touches on my wedding attire. If I haven't mentioned, both fiance and I are huge steampunk fans and so we're wearing steampunk attire and encouraging everyone else to dress in steampunk (not required, though). My \"wedding dress\" is actually more of a suit situation but it looks bad ass.\n\nI don't think I'll update again as I want to put all of this behind me and I don't plan to have any contact with my mother going forward. I'm looking forward to a bright future with my husband. My mom can stay in the past and as cold and heartless as it sounds, I'm glad she's not going to be my family's problem anymore.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DISCLAIMER: OOP HAS UPDATED AFTER THE BoRU WAS POSTED**\n\n**SO PER RULES UPDATE IS INCLUDED**\n\n[**Post-wedding update**](https://www.reddit.com/user/throwaway4meeeeeee86/comments/1744oi5/postwedding_update/?share_id=ztHb-zBzD3Mkm6rrDxyOH&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1) - **October 9, 2023 (Nine days later)**\n\nI just signed into this account again with a lot of people begging for updates. I don't have a lot. I guess my entire story is now in the best of Reddit. Thanks, I guess. I never knew dealing with my alcoholic mother was worthy of a best of post. I just wanted to rant and sanity check myself.\n\nOnly news on my mother is she's out of detox and currently in a \"catatonic state\" refusing to speak, eat, or drink water. They may install a feeding tube if she doesn't let up. I think she's trying to be dramatic and get attention, so do my uncles. I could be wrong, but honestly I don't care anymore. We're not sure she has dementia but she definitely has something going on but doing any kind of evaluation while she acts like this is difficult. She also has liver disease, needs dialysis and possibly even a transplant (if she qualifies). The doctors made it very clear if she doesn't quit drinking, she will die within the next 5 years and it may even still be too late. I think I'd feel more sad but I've had to realize that I lost my mother long ago. I did invite my mom's boyfriend but he chose not to come. He's decided to get help for his own alcohol issues, according my sister. I wish him the best.\n\nAs for the wedding, I'm now happily married and on Wednesday I took a pregnancy test that came back positive. We're super excited but haven't told anyone in our family yet. The wedding was fantastic and the day went off without a hitch. We had a blast and are heading out on our honeymoon on Wednesday to Costa Rica. My brothers and stepbrothers very sweetly hazed my husband during the at-home bachelor party and made it clear they're excited to have another brother. My stepmom did all of the mom stuff during the wedding. That was already planned before all of this. No one snuck in alcohol, there weren't any scenes. The worst that happened was my sister crying due to all of the stress she's been under. I do have some sympathy but most of it is self-inflicted though because she enables. But all in all, it was a great day and I was surrounded by those I love most. I know a lot of people asked for pics on my wedding suit. I will see if there's some way I can crop identifying stuff from it and post it here once I get my wedding pictures back. Otherwise, I'll figure out a way to post the outfits themselves.\n\nThat's all I have. I'll try and update after my honeymoon. Now it seems like baby is coming so no promises.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB \u0013 I AM NOT OOP**","subreddit":"BestofRedditorUpdates","comments":226,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/171wru2/aita_for_not_allowing_my_mother_to_bring_her/"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-06","timestamp":1696601344,"title":"Spot the Carbrain challenge (impossible)","text":"Top comment under this IG post.

Rover has been a nightmare to deal with. I am a service member who was in the process of pcsing and thus boarded my dog near my first duty station until we got our house at our new duty station. \n\n I was notified of pup\u0019s death with a less than 60 second phone call from the sitter and was given two hours to pick up his body despite being thousands of miles away. His injuries did not appear to be consistent with the sitter\u0019s 60 second explanation. Neither Rover nor the sitter offered to assist with transporting Zion\u0019s remains to be cremated despite knowing how far away I am. They also aren\u0019t offering to have his ashes mailed to me.\n\nRover has reached out to me numerous times from a recorded line. During my one call with Rover, I requested they pay for a necropsy (animal autopsy) as he was only 10 months old and the sitter\u0019s description of his death seemed suspicious. Rover told me no. Rover eventually said that they will think about it. Rover also tried to guilt trip me to \u001cconsider adopting a dog next time\u001d likely as a jab towards Zion being purebred.\n\nRover also pestered me (through calls and creepy emails) to provide a summary of what happened to Zion as part of their \u001cholistic safety review.\u001d When I asked for a copy of their review I was informed that \u001cdue to privacy concerns\u001d they will not share it. Rover now alleges that the sitter refuses to provide them a summary of how Zion died. Despite this, Rover will not commit to permanently banning this sitter from their platform.\n\nIf Rover cares about the safety of dogs on their platform, they need to commit to transparency with all users- by making any safety reviews public and funding necropsies for pets that die under unclear circumstances while in there care.\n\nUPDATE: I originally did not include Zion\u0019s cause of death as I did not want to upset people. However quite a few people are asking. The sitter claimed that he put Zion in a chainlink enclosure while they were doing yard work. During that time Zion (allegedly) jumped up and got his collar caught on a piece of decorative metal work on the gate. The sitter claimed that Zion essentially hung himself and was already deceased when sitter finished the yard work. As I was in another state, I had to scramble to get someone to pick him up. My ex-husband blessedly dropped what he was doing to pick up Zion\u0019s body.\n\nMy ex drove Zion\u0019s body around for a few hours while we waited for a response from Rover. my ex eventually became concerned about having the body in his car when it was over 105 degrees outside. He thus took zion to be cremated without a necropsy. The cremation people noted zion had no broken neck.\n\nI will also note that the collar zion wore when he died was put on and came from the sitter. I had zion in a vest but the sitter insisted he wear a gps collar the sitter had. I don\u0019t think zion could have strangled or hung himself if he had his vest on instead of the collar.","subreddit":"RoverPetSitting","comments":325,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/RoverPetSitting/comments/173ko83/10_month_old_golden_retriever_died_while_with/"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-11","timestamp":1697008402,"title":"I (f26) accidentally made my partner (m27) wait outside at 4am for over an hour.

So as far as I was concerned i\u0019d done my job for the night I could finally rest, phone back on silent and he\u0019d be home soon for cuddles.\nBut no, he didn\u0019t have his key and of course i was fast asleep and didn\u0019t hear my phone to the point he rang it so many times it died! \nHe didn\u0019t ring the bell cause he didn\u0019t want it to wake up my mom or son(5) but 2bh I would have rather he did. So he ended up waiting outside for over an hour until I eventually woke up realised he wasn\u0019t in bed and my phone was dead. I could literally feel the panic rush throughout h my body and I shot up to rush to the door and saw him standing there, I was met by some f\u0019s and offs\u0019 and I knew it wasn\u0019t good.\n\nHe is so so so so so angry at me and I completely understand why but then my argument is, I ask him about his key to avoid this very situation from happening because I know myself and I can drop like a fly when i\u0019m tired.\nAnyway I\u0019m not asking who\u0019s in the wrong because nothing was done intentionally or maliciously it\u0019s just a shitty situation. \nI just have no idea how to make things right, I know we\u0019ll probably get through it but then I also can see that this is bigger than any other time we\u0019ve \u001cargued\u001d and I genuinely do feel so horrible about it.

Weaponized incompetence, leaving women to bear the brunt of child rearing and the mental load, sexual harassment and violence, laws limiting our access to reproductive care/abortions, belittling or disregarding our experiences, entire religions focused on subjugating women, women's complaints being ignored in healthcare settings, the list goes on. \n\nI find myself regularly expecting or thinking the worst of men. Maybe it's the guy at the gas station who I feel is being creepy but he's just getting gas, or watching a young family at the grocery store and mom is corralling the kids while dad blissfully is along for the ride, noticing at large family functions its the women who eat last and get up first to clean up, interpreting interactions with my male industry peers as disrespectful. \n\nEven when I am watching a show/movie or reading a book, I spot negative behavior from the male characters and it sours it for me. For awhile if news came out about an artist or actor about them being general shitbags, I have an aversion to any media they put out, etc. \n\nIt's frustrating for me bc I am not a hateful person at all and I know a lot of wonderful men in my life. My husband is amazing and very much equally shares the mental load/kids/work, has never treated me as anything different than a whole person first, cried with me when RvW was overturned. My BIL is the same way with my sister, my dad and stepdad both have had always been my supporters and never made my sister or me feel like we couldn't do something because we're girls. I have friends with equally as adjusted and contributing partners and my husband and BIL. \n\nI have no lack of examples of loving, kind men around me but I still have this constant and nagging feeling that \"men suck\" and I can't help but notice the most minute details of patriarchy and sexism affecting things around me. \n\nI logically understand that this is a long standing societal and cultural issue and that any one individual is a sum of their experiences, and large changes are difficult to come about and maintain but that just feels like a cop out excuse to keep the staus quo and just ignore the very real and legitimate suffering women face daily. \n\nI've considered a media diet, but that just feels like cognitive dissonance now that the veil has been pulled back for me. Idk, maybe I just needed to scream into the void or hear other people's feelings on the subject.\n\n\nEdit: this is getting way more attention than I expected it to, and I'm excited that there's genuine discussion going on. I just wanted to clarify that I'm not condoning hating men \"bc they're men\" and I understand that the internet and reddit in particular can become an echo chamber. I do plan to take a step back from my use of reddit and sm bc it's clearly affecting me. \n\nI also wanted to clarify that while I think reddit/sm is exacerbating these feelings I'm having, the feelings didn't sprout from only exposure to things online and that my having some wonderful men in my life is not mutually exclusive to having negative experiences with men irl. \n\nI've had a doctor tell me I'm less intelligent and capable bc I'm a woman while in grad school. \nI've had male patients tell me I should stay home insread of work. \nI've been SA'd, know of endless other women who've had similar experiences. \nI've had men assume I'm flirting with them, hang around the bar until I got off work, and try to follow me to my car when I was just taking their drink order. \nI've been groped on public transport. \nI've had to take a friend to the hospital and be there for her as she gives a statement to the police bc her husband choked her to unconsciousness. \nI've watched parts of my extended family defend my child molester uncle to not rock the boat. \nI've been cornered by men while taking a walk on the beach, and only came out safe bc I lied through my teeth that my husband was meeting me.\nI had a predatory and disgusting youth pastor throughout middle school that took advantage of one of my friends. \n\nThese are just examples that I am recalling quickly, but if I sat here long enough, I could think of A LOT more. And it's this life long and continuous exposure in my lived experiences where these feelings of frustration, disillusionment, and helplessness started.\n\n\n\n\nTldr: I don't want to automatically dislike or think the worst of men, but don't know how to not feel that way in face of the constant exposure to adversities women face daily.","subreddit":"TwoXChromosomes","comments":998,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/16tj3mf/does_any_one_else_worry_about_their_internal/"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-25","timestamp":1695637938,"title":"romantic vandal","text":"Seriously though, I feel bad for the person who will have to clean that. @ Flinders st station.","subreddit":"melbourne","comments":44,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/16rocwy/romantic_vandal/"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-11","timestamp":1697040945,"title":"I don't like teachers who are funny and make jokes to relax the class","text":"Both in college and in high school, I always hated teachers who made jokes, told personal stories during class and spent their time talking about other subjects that had nothing to do with the lesson.\n\nThat's because I had to get up at 6 a.m., sometimes take 2 public transports to get to class at 8 a.m. to listen to someone who is getting paid to talk about their personal life as if they were in a therapy session?

My boyfriend claims he's fine with it, but his behavior suggests otherwise. Overall, our communication is good, but I'm bothered by his sudden change regarding this situation.\n\nMy ex and I were together for four years, but we amicably separated six years ago as we grew apart, typical of young love. Since I spent two of those four years living at his parents' house, I grew close to his family and friends, some of whom I still stay in daily contact with, including my ex (mainly on Snapchat, but we don't chat much \u0013 it's mostly for sharing updates or keeping streaks).\n\nThat's why I visit the town 100km away every year for the annual \"town festival,\" to see old faces, share stories, and have fun. The festival lasts from Friday evening to Sunday afternoon, and I often help with serving, setting up, and cleaning.\n\nI've been dating my current boyfriend for four months, locally. It's a relatively new relationship, but I've learned from past relationships the importance of open communication, which has worked well for us. I've never hidden the fact that I'm still friends with my ex, nor that nothing has happened between us since the breakup.\n\nA few days ago, we discussed our weekend plans for the next few weeks, and I mentioned my upcoming visit to my ex's home in two weeks. He didn't take it well, even though he had never had an issue with our friendship before. He finds it \"weird\" and \"odd\" that I'm visiting my ex while being in a new relationship, and I agree with him. I'm aware that it's not the norm.\n\nI've never given him a reason not to trust me. I've never cheated in past relationships, and having experienced being cheated on myself, I know how painful it is, and I'd never do that. He says he trusts me, or rather, he says he \"has to trust me\" because he has no other choice. He doesn't forbid me from visiting my ex, but his tone and behavior indicate that it bothers him. When I asked him how he feels about it, he simply said, \"I can't change it, so it doesn't matter what I think.\"\n\nI understand that communication is a learning curve, and this is his first longer-term relationship, so I'm willing to be patient as we both navigate this. However, it's been five days since we first talked about it, and there's no improvement in sight. I'll definitely still visit my ex because my main goal is to see people I'm not in touch with on social media. But I don't know how long I can tolerate my boyfriend's lack of communication. It's just a tiny part of our relationship. Most of the time, he communicates openly. It's just in this case, he's not, and it's bothering me immensely.\n\nEdit: Thank you very much in advance for all the comments. Unfortunately, I have a very busy weekend ahead, so I won't be able to respond to everyone, but I will read every comment. Just from quickly skimming through, I've already noticed some things that will definitely give me food for thought.\n\nEdit 2: Just a few things I've read a few times; I offered my boyfriend to come along. My ex's parents took me in like their own child, and I'm sure they would be excited to meet my boyfriend, their \"foundling.\" However, my boyfriend declined without giving a reason. He also didn't want to meet my ex beforehand, claiming it would be \"weird.\"\n\nEdit 3: My \"main issue\" is that I'd like to talk about the whole situation, possibly find a compromise, and ease both his and my conscience. However, it's challenging when he doesn't want to discuss it with me. That would be fine; we don't have to talk about everything. But he denies that there's anything to discuss, yet at the same time, he makes passive-aggressive comments that suggest he's not okay with it.\n\nEdit 4: I wouldn't have a problem if he visited an ex. I generally trust him until he gives me a reason not to. But apparently, that might be naive of me?\n\nEdit 5: I won't be staying in my ex's house; I'll be staying with his neighbor, with whom I'm in daily contact.\n\nEdit 6: I can't exactly pinpoint my question for you. I think I just wanted to get this off my chest, sort out my thoughts.\n\n---\n\n#A few comments\n\n&gt; You would do that to me exactly twice: the first and the last time. Unbelievable behavior.\n\n&gt; Who does something like that =\u0005 I would never in my life let my girlfriend go to her ex, let alone stay overnight. Even maintaining contact with the parents and, even worse, the ex, I can't comprehend. I couldn't do it in my life, and I think it's very rare for another guy not to care if his girlfriend talks to her ex. Usually, it's a big no-go. I don't know anyone who would be cool with it.\n\n&gt; I can understand that you don't want to simply give up on your acquaintances/friends from the past. However, please be aware that this is a tough pill for your boyfriend to swallow. He's your ex, and I assume you'll be staying there as well? That would be a problem for many. Your boyfriend seems to be doing his best to cope with the situation and isn't forbidding anything, yet you're still dissatisfied? He's showing you that it hurts him, and you (in my opinion) are just finding faults in him (communication) instead of seeing what you're currently expecting/demanding from him. I don't want to attack you, but I want to give you some food for thought: your views on meetings with ex-partners and perfect communication may not necessarily align with his. Give him some time to process this, instead of counting the days when, in your opinion, he's not \"functioning ideally\n\n---\n\n#Update\n\n[**UPDATE: My (F27) boyfriend (M29) has a problem with me visiting my ex-boyfriend (M28) and won't admit it.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/beziehungen/comments/16shlu6/)\n\nTuesday, September 26 2023 (a month later)\n\n*removed TLDR of first post*\n\nFirst of all, a massive thank you to everyone who commented. As I mentioned, I didn't have time to respond to everyone over the weekend, but I read everything multiple times. You tore me apart in the comments, but that's exactly what I needed \u0013 a wake-up call. I realized that I definitely mishandled the whole situation by presenting my boyfriend with a fait accompli. That was pretty selfish of me, probably because I haven't been in a serious relationship for six years and had gotten used to a lifestyle where I only had to consider myself for decisions. But that's, of course, no excuse or justification for my actions, so on to the actual update.\n\nAfter the weekend, I initiated another conversation with my boyfriend. First and foremost, I apologized and basically explained to him what I wrote above. That my freedom over the past few years had apparently made me selfish and uncompromising, and that I definitely need to work on myself and how I communicate things.\n\nI then tried to explain to him in more detail why visiting my ex was so important to me. His family took me in when my parents kicked me out back then. They loved me as if I were their own child, just when I needed it most. Not just once did they pull me out of a depressive (in one case, even suicidal) pit, and I will be forever grateful for that. I'm still in regular contact with my ex's friends and meet up with someone from the group about every two months. I tried to make him understand that I'm not specifically going to see my ex but everyone who lives in that village. The annual town festival is THE weekend of the year when everyone comes together there. I told him how sorry I was but that the visit had been arranged for almost 10 months, and they were also counting on my help with the festival, and I would feel guilty. I had been looking forward to the festival for so long that not being able to go would break my heart a little. But despite all of this, none of these things were the end of the world, and they could somehow be straightened out. If he really wanted me to, I could cancel it.\n\nHis reaction surprised me. He communicated that, thanks to the detailed explanation, he now understood and was happy for me to see those people again. He said that what had originally bothered him was how I had communicated it. He told me to go and have fun. However, he couldn't come along due to other commitments. The following two weeks were quite uneventful. Whenever the visit was mentioned, he genuinely seemed happy for me.\n\nFast forward to the Friday I was supposed to leave. I came home from work at noon, packed the last of my things, and was ready to drive off. Except I couldn't find my car keys. I was sure they were on the hook that morning, but they weren't there. I searched the entire house. Nada, nothing. I then messaged my boyfriend, who was still at work, asking if he had seen them. After half an hour, he replied that he didn't know, but he could check his pockets to see if they were there. I thanked him and waited. Another half-hour passed, and he messaged that they were indeed in his pocket but that I didn't need to come to get them (it would take 30 minutes each way by public transport) because he'd be home in an hour anyway.\n\nI thought, alright, I'll wait for that hour and then leave. That way, I'll see him again before I go. After an hour and a half of waiting, I called him. He was still out with a colleague having a drink. At that moment, I had already given up on leaving that day without being overly tired. I told him not to rush, that I'd wait. So, I laid down on the couch and watched some TV series. Shortly before 11 at night, my boyfriend came home slightly tipsy and acted like everything was normal. I asked him if he could give me the car key so that I could leave early in the morning. After a few minutes of hesitation, he said that he had left it at work.\n\nUp until that point, I had remained calm because mistakes can happen. But then, I got angry. I asked if he was serious. Yes, he said, he was sorry, but there was nothing he could do now. The office was closed until Monday. But we could have a nice weekend at home. At that moment, I still didn't want to believe that he had orchestrated all of this, although the thought had briefly crossed my mind. I also couldn't talk about it anymore and started crying. To calm myself down, I decided to take my luggage and stay with a friend. In response, he left the room without saying a word and returned a minute later with the car key, which he had suddenly \"found\" and asked me to stay until the next morning.\n\nAfter another 15 minutes of crying, I drove to my friend's place anyway, and the next morning, I went to my ex-boyfriend's. Because I was there to help with the festival, I didn't have time to think about the situation or talk to him. But during the car ride home, I spent a long time trying to find a logical explanation for his behavior. I failed miserably. It's not even his car. He hardly ever drives my car, and when he does, he usually asks beforehand. So, I was pretty sure that all of this was planned. When I got home, he acted as if everything was okay, but he still seemed passive-aggressive. After unpacking, I confronted him during dinner about whether the whole thing was really an \"accident.\"\n\nAfter repeatedly asking him because things seemed illogical to me (e.g., why he should take my key to work at all), he suddenly got very angry. He said he never said or meant it that way. Was I too stupid to understand his words? Both he and I exchanged insults and shouted at each other. Then a plate flew in my direction, and I left and spent the rest of the day with friends. I knew the relationship was over, but he may not have realized it yet. The next day, while he was at work, two friends and I packed all of his things, and then we waited for him to come home. He probably thought he could talk his way out of it again, but I told him it was over. He didn't want to accept it until he saw his packed things. He became loud and aggressive again, but after a ten-minute tirade, he finally returned my house key (threw it on the ground and spat on it) with the words \"You damn slut, you'll regret this when you die alone! But at least you can screw your ex without a guilty conscience. That was surely your plan, that's what you wanted, right?\" and then he left. Since then, I've blocked him everywhere and haven't seen him, and I hope it stays that way.\n\nI used to think that stories like these, when you read them on Reddit, are often exaggerated or even made up. And now something this crazy happened to me. I have no idea where it came from or how deep these aggressions were lurking inside him. To be honest, I'm still shocked by what came out of him. I've never been so afraid of another person and actually don't want to deal with the incident anymore, which is why the ending is probably quite short and lacking detail compared to the rest of the story.\n\nTLDR:\n\nI sincerely apologized and promised to work on myself. My boyfriend told me he forgave me and it was okay for me to visit my ex, but on the day I was supposed to leave, he hid my car keys to stop me. I ended up going anyway, and when I returned home, he exploded because I went. He threw a plate at me. Now he's also my ex-boyfriend (but I definitely won't be visiting him).\n\n---\n\n#A few comments\n\n&gt; You made the right decision to break up with him. Such manipulative behavior destroys trust, and you can't have a relationship with someone who plays such games. I'm sorry it escalated this way. Aggressive behavior is also unacceptable. Obviously, it made him very insecure that you went to see your ex. I think almost anyone would have felt strange about it. I would have asked him if he wanted to come along instead of excluding him. Before the relationship failed, your communication failed. However, that does not justify his behavior under any circumstances.\n\n&gt; The comments section is wild. Many seem unable to distinguish between \"allowing/prohibiting\" and \"you can do XY, but I have the following opinion and will probably draw those consequences.\" The end result may be the same, but the former implies a power imbalance, while the latter does not. Allowing or prohibiting things is done with children or people over whom one thinks they have control. The other option is a relationship on an equal footing, where each person can decide for themselves about possible consequences. So, if someone wants to visit their ex, you can say, \"You are welcome to do that; however, I don't like it for these and those reasons, and I will reconsider our relationship.\" Then both sides know where they stand on this matter and can make a decision with appropriate consequences. For some, this might be a deal-breaker, for others not. Hiding car keys, manipulating, and throwing dishes are absolutely unacceptable. It's good that OP decided to end the relationship.\n\n---\n\n**Reminder - I am not the original poster and the posts and comments were originally in German**\n\n*Marked as concluded as they broke up.*","subreddit":"BestofRedditorUpdates","comments":658,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1722f9j/my_f27_boyfriend_m29_has_a_problem_with_me/"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-09","timestamp":1696810836,"title":"How is this allowed?","text":"2hr 18 on car\n\n1day 5hr on public transportation\n\n156 miles.","subreddit":"fuckcars","comments":107,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/173ebmr/how_is_this_allowed/"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-16","timestamp":1694867636,"title":"My (28F) husband(28M) decided to go on a trip with his parents and their friends.

I pushed him away and loudly stated that he is overstepping boundaries, to which he became aggressive (I'm glad my destination was the next stop). The second one happened today, while I was at Uni, when the Chancellor declared that God shall guide all of the students in the new academic year, and a priest proceeded to walk into every seminar room and bless it.

My aunt paid for repairs on it when I initially took it and i've been spending the last year paying her in monthly 250$ increments. \n\nI found out that my car insurance expired two days ago. the day before I got paid. when I had -2.50 in my bank account and was praying they wouldn't throw another overdraft fee onto me again. Yesterday when I got paid, I got 940$\n\nI work full-time. in an administrative position for a college. the job is union contract, so I have to start at the bottom - 18$ an hour.\n\nWith it comes benefits. so after all the taxes and benefit payments pulled out, that's what I get.\n\nI rent a room in my friends' (a married couple) house for 450$\n\nI commute to and from work daily about 40 minutes, so that's about 200 per bi-weekly pay period for gas. \n\nThat leaves me with 40$ for anything else. food, phone bill, extra mileage....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe public transportation in my region is HORRIFIC. there are maybe 2 bus lines. It's an expansive suburban area - with a small airport, conveniently located between 3 major cities so a lot of people commute (or work remotely now). From where I live to work it would take me 2 hours to commute one way. It would save me maybe 100$ per month in transportation costs. but 4 hours of my life, and I'm already struggling with getting enough sleep. \n\nI work another job moonlighting as a paralegal where most of my assignments I can do remotely. It's 20$/ hour. But I track every task I do to the 10th of each hour, or every 6 minutes, so it's not a lot of income. It's not like I'm being paid to be somewhere and do things at whatever pace it requires, if it takes me 5 minutes to write a letter, i only get paid for 5 minutes. I don't assignments regularly or frequently so it's not reliable income. But it IS good work experience and a good work relationship - as I want to go to law school....someday....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbut all of that is beyond my imagination right now because I'm freaking out about how I'm going to be able to afford to commute to work next week, pay for this renewal of my car insurance, the inspection and emissions, an oil change, a tire replacement, eat.....\n\nI love my job and the people treat me here so well too. The school just doesn't get a say in how much I get paid, because it's a union contract - all staff on campus have the same circumstances.\n\nBut i don't have a spouse with additional income to support me, my own home closer to work (I looked, there is nothing under 1300$ month and they require 3x that income to even qualify) or another full-time well-paying job. I don't have a car that's in good condition and already paid off. I'm not drinking, buying expensive food or even fast food...\n\nI spent merely 30$ for a card and small discounted gift for my best friend's baby shower.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to do. I need this job's experience in order to move forward into anything else, and I feel terrible to quit on them anytime soon because they had such a hard time for several months when their last admin suddenly passed away. \n\nI need advice. Encouragement. Someone tell me I'm going to be okay and that life is worth living. because I'm really miserable right now all just because i can't afford to exist. Hell, even just 4 more dollars per hour would help me a lot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;","subreddit":"povertyfinance","comments":305,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/16jdbn3/i_am_not_financially_irresponsible_i_just/"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-14","timestamp":1694706935,"title":"Better then being crowded up in a car.","text":"","subreddit":"TheRightCantMeme","comments":170,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRightCantMeme/comments/16im1wf/better_then_being_crowded_up_in_a_car/"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-02","timestamp":1696216402,"title":"AITA for not \"saving\" my gf's drivers license and refusing to drive her to and from work?","text":"My (28m) GF (26f) is always late.

THE TIME.\n\nShe snoozes her alarm at least three times every morning, then lays there going through her social media.\n\nEventually she gets up and takes a long ass shower, dresses (Which takes her forever, and she usually sits wrapped in a towel on her phone), then lingers over her coffee.  9 times out of 10 she's running late for work, and ends up speeding to make it on time.\n\nNaturally, she's gotten a number of speeding tickets.  I've tried to help her - eg putting her phone where she can't reach it from bed so she has to get up to snooze it, but she literally just grabs it and goes back to bed.\n\nYou try to get her to move her ass and she just digs in her heels and takes even longer.  Her response to people calling out her lateness is \"better late than dead on time\".\n\nAnyway, again, she was running even later than normal for work, and really had to speed to make it.  A week goes by and sure enough, massive speeding fine in the mail.\n\nShe now has to hand in her drivers license because she's got so many demerit points, she'll be without one for 6 months.\n\nInstead of just dealing with it, she TELLS me \"I'll need you to cop this one and say you were driving so I don't lose my license\" and of course, I refused, telling her she needs to live with the consequences of her actions and maybe she should stop speeding, and wake up earlier.\n\nThis argument went on for a few days until she finally conceded, then proceeds to tell me \"well, you'll have to drive me to and from work until I get my license back\", and I tell her I won't be doing that - her work is literally in another direction than my work is from home, and doing so would add another two hours of driving per day.  She says it shouldn't matter as my work has flexible hours, but I stood my ground and refused, and said she can take public transport - there's literally a bus stop 2 mins walk from our house and the bus stops maybe 5 mins walk from her work, and it's quite regular,\n\nShe says she hates public transport and refuses to ride it, so I said then it's Uber for her, or organise a car pool, but bottom line, it's not my responsibility.\n\nShe called me an AH and is giving me the silent treatment, said a decent boyfriend would go to those lengths for her and that it's only 6 months.\n\nSo, am I AH for not \"saving her license\" and refusing to drive her to and from work for 6 months?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL,DR:  Gf is always running late, speeds to work, gets caught, loses license, expects me to cop the blame so she can keep her license, I Refuse, she then expects me to drive her to and from work but it's literally out of my way, says I'm the AH.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  We live in Brisbane, Australia for those wondering\n\nADD: Update in comments.\n\nADD: Further / final update in comments.","subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","comments":360,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xln17/aita_for_not_saving_my_gfs_drivers_license_and/"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-19","timestamp":1695144285,"title":"A police officer removes the glued hand of an activist of the \"Letzte Generation\", who glued themself to a street in Charlottenburg district to protest for climate councils, a speed limit on highways as well as for affordable public transport in Berlin, Germany. photo: Fabrizio Bensch","text":"","subreddit":"europe","comments":1029,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/16mwyd5/a_police_officer_removes_the_glued_hand_of_an/"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-06","timestamp":1696579794,"title":"=@","text":"","subreddit":"Clamworks","comments":15,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Clamworks/comments/1716o93/_/"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-14","timestamp":1694653517,"title":"Told interviewer they need to pay $20k more a year for me to go into office","text":"I was approached for a role recently and they asked me about how I feel about going into the office.

The digitization of the election campaigns meant that votes could be cast electronically, in the privacy of their homes, and well in advance of the opening of physical polls. Several identifiers, including biomarkers, were used to verify their identity; early votes could be changed at any time up to the closing of the ballot collection. However, in the interests of not singling out anyone with connectivity problems or who couldn\u0019t access an electronic device, in-person voting facilities were open on the big week. Many citizens preferred being part of the herd, and exercising their civic rights among a crowd.\n\nThe results from the large percentage of online voters would be accessible almost instantly, but physical votes from each city, outpost, or colony had to be forwarded by local governments. I hadn\u0019t felt this nervous during my first election, yet the uncertainty of who would emerge victorious today gnawed at me. Polls were indecisive, with turnout from certain demographics likely to play a major part in who was victorious. A major setback was that most human citizens had been barred from participating in the election, which could\u0019ve pushed me over the edge. The soul of Skalga was at stake, in my opinion, and I wasn\u0019t sure how much of our progress Veln could reverse if he took office. His isolationism would bring us further away from humanity at the worst possible time.\n\n*I\u0019ve done everything I can with social media outreach and campaign ads. I\u0019ve visited every major city, and run myself ragged going to rural villages and colonies where my popularity is&subpar. Any voters I could sway in Veln\u0019s strongholds would increase my chances.*\n\nWith the polls due to close in only a few minutes, I found myself watching a compilation of attack ads that Veln had spent significant money circulating on the airwaves and the internet. It wasn\u0019t as if I was innocuous on this front; I\u0019d gone after his meteoric rise as the nominated challenger, claiming he gained the most signatures by inflating his accomplishments within a small colony\u0019s government. \u001cVeln isn\u0019t ready to handle the responsibility of all Venlilkind,\u001d my tagline had proclaimed. I did see my opponent as clever, but someone who lacked a moral backbone or a good vision for our future. My rival was clever enough to claim his platform worked on any scale he\u0019d tackled so far, and slammed my policies by clipping out-of-context quotes.\n\n\u001cTarva has proven that she cannot handle the responsibility for Venlilkind. Her unilateral decisions have given **you** no say in your future,\u001d the ad narrator declared, as images of predator disease patients being led out of facilities by humans played on screen. \u001cShe takes her ideas straight from the new predators. This was her claim about humans\u0019 knowledge of predator disease.\u001d\n\nA clip of me from the debate played on-screen. \u001cThey have a better idea than we do of what\u0019s actually predator behavior.\u001d\n\n\u001cDo you want a puppet leader that trusts humanity\u0019s judgment over our own? Do you think predators have *better ideas* than us?\u001d The footage showed my rival touring an exterminators\u0019 guild on his colony, and signing documents. \u001cVeln is not a follower. He\u0019s a *leader* who will listen to what the people want. You know who to vote for.\u001d\n\nI leaned away from Noah on the couch, and held the remote out of his reach as he tried to cut the feed. Glim seemed apathetic from his position in a reclining chair; the rescue had been taken off my last campaign stops, despite how useful he would be to court the exterminator vote. In his current state, he would\u0019ve done more harm than good to my message. It would look like the Terrans were coercing him into supporting me. The next ad in the compilation rolled, going after me on my ties to Earth again.\n\n\u001cWhile Tarva was running around, chasing the human ambassador, Veln was working for his constituents. Listen to her own words about how much of her policies and recent efforts have centered around Earth,\u001d a different narrator read.\n\nMy eyes were narrowed with indignance on screen. \u001cWe\u0019ve been through many stressful situations together, from nearly getting shot down en route to Aafa, to our efforts to stop the genocide of Earth, to working hand-in-paw with the cattle rescues that my government and his bargained for the release of, and now to our collaboration for the Summit.\u001d\n\n\u001cNot only did Tarva *admit* to negotiating with the Arxur, a true predator scourge that eats our children\u0014and ate her own\u0014she also listed all her accomplishments as things on humanity\u0019s agenda. There is no difference between our planets under her leadership.\u001d Behind the narrator\u0019s words, images played of me running with Meier and Noah, as humans stampeded and smoke rose in the background. \u001cBy her own admission on the debate stage, your goods will cost more because of higher value-added taxes to fund *these* adventures. And for all of that, the question remains: what has she done for you? Is your planet better now than it was six years ago?\u001d\n\nThe clip ended with the words *Vote Veln. No More Federations.* flashing atop a picture of my rival holding a baby Venlil. I couldn\u0019t deny that he was excellent at the political game, and it made me seethe. Noah didn\u0019t want me to wind myself up,  pouncing toward me to grab my wrist. He pried the remote from my grasp, and switched it over to a livestream of a news channel. The human winked, before pointing to a clock on the mantle. I flicked my ear in acknowledgment, hearing activity through my campaign headquarters.\n\nMy diplomatic advisor, Cheln, peeked his head. \u001cRight on time. The polls have closed. I prepared speeches for both outcomes, ma\u0019am, and sent them to your holopad.\u001d\n\n\u001cThank you. Whatever happens, it\u0019s been an honor working with you,\u001d I acknowledged. \u001cHow are the exit polls looking?\u001d\n\n\u001cDepends on the jurisdiction. You\u0019re polling poorly in rural areas, colonies, or the places with the strongest exterminator guilds. Dayside City is leaning toward you, which is good.\u001d\n\nNoah bared his teeth. \u001cThink good thoughts, Tarva. You have a heart of gold; they\u0019d be silly not to re-elect you.\u001d\n\n\u001cMaybe. We both know the amount of change I\u0019ve brought has put me in a precarious position. The polls seem to have slid toward him since the debate; I thought I did well, but those sound bites about humans are hurting me.\u001d\n\n\u001cI\u0019m glad you\u0019ve stood up for us, even when it\u0019s not easy. What do you think, Glim?\u001d\n\nThe rescue offered a blank stare. \u001cI think we\u0019re going to lose. Not because people all hate humans, but because people hate how Tarva is *way* too close to you. And they\u0019re right. You two literally bite each other\u0019s faces.\u001d\n\nCheln pinned his ears back against his head. \u001cWait, what?\u001d\n\n\u001cGlim\u0019s not well. You\u0019re dismissed, Cheln,\u001d I said hastily.\n\nThe diplomatic advisor couldn\u0019t depart from the room soon enough, and he rejoined the larger crowd assembled around a massive screen in the lobby. I would be there when the results were expected to be known, but in this election, it could come down to the wire. Noah seemed aggravated at Glim, despite the fact that the sweet human rarely showed anger toward any Venlil. Even his patience had limits, though he forgot about the rescue\u0019s snide remarks as his eyes darted to our television set. The Terran beamed and pecked me on the cheek, as the 64% who voted early had tilted 50.8% in my favor, compared to Veln\u0019s 49.2%.\n\nHowever, I knew better than to celebrate this early, with it being this close and the rural villages being the ones that skewed toward in-person ballot casting. It would\u0019ve been preferable if my margin here was wider, rather than depending on the last third of the votes to be favorable. I cozied up to the astronaut with unspeakable weariness, shooting a warning look at Glim not to mouth off again. After the unfathomable stress of the past few months, I wasn\u0019t sure I was ready for this claw-biting, long night waiting for results to come in across our space.\n\n\\---\n\nDayside City, the capital and home of the most humans on Skalga, was among the first provinces to send results. 65% of the in-person voters called for my re-election, though I wasn\u0019t sure how much I should read into that. The ones who were Terran dissidents had long since moved out of the city, so if anything, it was discouraging that nearly a third had sided with Veln. Other major cities turned out even less promising results, with me narrowly holding the physical votes in almost all, except for Tonalu City skewing 53.4% toward my opponent. That still padded my lead, and Noah seemed ready to take a victory lap. I respected his optimism.\n\n*I don\u0019t know why, but I\u0019ve had a bad feeling about this election since the day began. Maybe it\u0019s just my nerves&internally, I\u0019m not confident I have the support of my people. Even if I do win, it\u0019s clear from these margins that the planet is divided.*\n\nThat was the last good news we\u0019d had in the evening. Rural villages like Celgel Falls, home to Glim\u0019s aunt, poured in their tepid amounts of votes, but several skewed around the 75% mark in Veln\u0019s favor. While one small settlement wouldn\u0019t have been enough to make a dent in my lead of millions, together, they were eating into the metropolitan vote. These people had always been traditionalists, and were known to be less than cordial with human refugees; lack of interaction with Terrans meant they never had the opportunity to change their minds.\n\n\u001cYou can\u0019t win them all,\u001d Noah had said, trying to massage the tension from my shoulders.\n\nThe issue was that I wasn\u0019t winning any, and that my campaign efforts in those areas didn\u0019t seem to have stopped the bleeding. It was a blowout in every single village, which I could imagine Veln feeling the swing of momentum. The colonies only lowered the gap further, and the numbers made my heart plummet. My opponent had been actively ferrying voters on his home colony, Milna, to the polls, and even been on one of those transports himself to plead his case in his already strongest territory. I thought it had been a foolish play, since he already had their votes as a popular governor, but rehashing his beloved tenure paid dividends. Milna was one of the last colonies to report their totals because they nearly doubled a record in-person turnout; Veln was seen as their candidate.\n\n\u001cVeln is a hometown hero who hasn\u0019t forgotten his roots, if you ask voters on Milna,\u001d Jonek had announced on the election coverage broadcast. \u001cOff of Venlil Prime\u0019s soil, she\u0019s seen as the Governor of humans. Perhaps it would\u0019ve been wise to distance herself more from the UN.\u001d\n\n*Not good. Colonies never feel attached to affairs of the homeworld, but even ones without Veln the visitor are bringing turnout. They have a stake in the humans\u0019 arrival, and the ones who don\u0019t are no more inclined to vote than past elections.*\n\nMy numerical advantage had been millions away from my opponent, and seemed insurmountable to Noah, had shrunk to a sliver as the night progressed. The rural villages whittled down my advantage to half of its original count; the unexpected turnout at Milna was the start of a continuing skid. By the time all colonies had reported, my lead was at a mere 493 votes. I fielded calls from the UN Secretary-General wishing me luck and thanking me for everything I\u0019d done for humanity, which I think was Zhao\u0019s way of saying they thought there was a good chance I might lose. The Earthlings must be scrambling to figure out how to deal with a possible Governor Veln, and they didn\u0019t want to spring goodbyes on me if I was unseated.\n\nJonek perked his ears as the camera, as the news broadcast returned from a break. \u001cHello! If you\u0019re tuning in expecting us to hear who the new Governor of Skalga is, we have one province outstanding\u0014the science settlement of Eliga, which has been under sandstorm conditions and is just making contact now. I\u0019m told we can expect results from them in a few minutes. What an election it\u0019s been! Polling in Eliga has been a tossup, and it wasn\u0019t visited by Tarva or Veln: this could go either way.\u001d\n\n\u001cWe should go outside with the others,\u001d Noah whispered. \u001cGovernor or not, I\u0019ll always love you.\u001d\n\nI wrapped my prosthetic tail around his wrist. \u001cI love you too. If I had to do everything all over again, the only thing I\u0019d change is sending that distress signal in the first place. We\u0019ll get through this.\u001d\n\n\u001cOf course we will! Worst that happens is you retire from public service, and we get to run off together like I\u0019ve imagined for months. That\u0019s not so terrible, right?\u001d\n\n\u001cIt is what I want, but humanity needs me in charge of Skalga, to preserve our close alliance.\u001d\n\n\u001cThe Venlil can\u0019t go back completely, love. You gave us a chance, you made sure millions of people who never would\u0019ve thought about dealing with predators did the same, and you *saved* our species to boot. You\u0019ve done so much; we couldn\u0019t ask any more. Don\u0019t worry about humans, because you\u0019ve done more than your part on our behalf.\u001d\n\nEmotion swelled in my throat, as I marched toward the doorway to enter the lobby with the rest of the staff. These could be my last moments as the leader of Skalga; regardless of what Noah said, I felt responsible for the efficacy of my campaign strategies. How could I justify keeping our relationship quiet to maintain my office if I lost my position to a populist charmer like Veln? How could I have any say in decisions affecting millions of Terran refugees on this planet?  I cared about what happened to the Earthlings; that was the sole reason I sought re-election at all\u0014for their sake.\n\nNoah glanced over his shoulder toward Glim. \u001cDo you want to come with us, and watch the results with the group? We\u0019d love for you to join us.\u001d\n\n\u001cNo,\u001d the rescue mumbled.\n\n\u001cWhy not? You were a part of this team as much as anyone else.\u001d\n\n\u001cI helped Tarva because I owed her my life&not b-because I think she\u0019s a fitting Governor. A real Venlil wouldn\u0019t have argued for&f-for an Arxur to speak at the Summit. I hope Veln wins.\u001d\n\nI flinched at that sudden admission from the cattle rescue. How could he oppose my candidacy, after my policies freed millions like him from abhorrent conditions? I had volunteered to help with the reintroduction program because I cared about these mistreated Venlil. A scowl took over my astronaut\u0019s features, and his fist clenched beneath my coiled tail. Noah didn\u0019t speak another word to Glim, instead hurrying out with me to the lobby. I tried to clear that exchange from my mind, but the sinking feeling that plagued me all day had reached its crescendo. I didn\u0019t have a good feeling about how the votes from Eliga would shake out in my gut.\n\n\u001cMa\u0019am.\u001d Kam flicked his ears in acknowledgement, as we fell in beside him and Cheln. \u001cThe moment of truth. I\u0019ve argued on behalf of your policies, even when I didn\u0019t agree with them. You couldn\u0019t have been more right about humans. I\u0019m proud to have served your administration.\u001d\n\n\u001cThank you, General,\u001d I whispered. \u001cThank you for your service to our planet. Let\u0019s save the goodbyes or congratulations for after we hear the results, though.\u001d\n\n\u001cCopy that.\u001d\n\nAn eerie silence overtook the lobby area, as dozens of staffers saw Jonek scan some new information off screen. The Venlil journalist took a moment to prepare himself, savoring the suspense of the ultimate verdict. The knowing glint in his eyes confirmed that the results of the election were known, before he ever said a word. Eliga flashed orange to signify that it had been tallied on the visual aid map; all we needed was to hear the counts that would usher me into a second term, or elect a new Governor in my stead. It was all I could do not to bury my eyes in Noah\u0019s chest, and press my paws over my ears to avoid hearing. The impending news was almost too much to bear.\n\nJonek cleared his throat. \u001cEliga has submitted its votes, and with the last outstanding province in, Dayside News Feed can now declare the new Governor-elect. After winning the city\u0019s vote by a percentage of 54.6%, the 103rd Governor of the Venlil homeworld will be&\u001d\n\nThe journalist paused for dramatic effect, and my breath hitched in my throat. The election would be delivered with his next words, signaling what the voters had chosen for the future of Skalga. I hoped that, whatever decision they had reached, it would turn out well for both the Venlil people and our sincerest allies.\n\n\\---\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/u19xpa/the_nature_of_predators/) | [Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/16w7un9/the_nature_of_predators_155/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/172779y/the_nature_of_predators_157/)\n\n[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/spacepaladin15) | [Something About Blue \\[New\\]](https://www.patreon.com/posts/nature-of-about-88376972) | [Series wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/hfy/wiki/series/the_nature_of_predators) *|* [Official subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/Dqj4HkRdpw)","subreddit":"HFY","comments":214,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/16zudi8/the_nature_of_predators_156/"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-25","timestamp":1695625671,"title":"Absolutely ridiculous that the link stops before midnight.","text":"I just got off an Amtrak train at 11:50pm, and apparently missed the last train.

Ashton Twitterson here. Many people asked for a comprehensive list of the evidence of the MH370 videos, so I delivered.\n\nMost people's immediate reaction will be that the MH370 videos are stupid or impossible, but they line up with all the facts to date. Don't believe me or trust me, verify the evidence. The US Government made a huge mistake recording this event, there's no excuse they can use to deny it.\n\nIf you want to destroy all credibility in world governments, here is your unique opportunity.\n\nEach piece of evidence can be verified, either visually in the video, from works of the community, or my own investigative research. If it\u0019s not on this list I either haven\u0019t verified it or don\u0019t find it to be credibly linked to the investigation at this time.\n\nI am limited in images that can be used or I would add more. I only put links and sources when it's a contentious point. When the time comes all those who contributed will be given credit.\n\nQuick Disclaimer - This is not Qanon. This is not to distract from Trump or Biden. This is not an alien invasion. This is not a hoax, misinformation, or disinformation. There are ufology elements but that does not mean it is the explanation.\n\nThis is the power of the community used to tell the story of the greatest conspiracy of all time.\n\n\\-Ashton\n\nNote - I don't want to talk to any MSM.

I'm not native Bangalore an but I've come to love the city in the last 1.5 years I've been here. And during this time I've come to a realization that the collective greed in this city is the biggest challenge the city faces. I've lived in multiple cities before. Originally from UP, I've lived in Kanpur, Lucknow, Delhi, Noida, Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Bhopal and I've never seen a city as eager to rip you off as Bangalore. From landlords and autovallahs to the freaking government, everyone wants to get their hands on other people's money. The public transport is shit, at best and a freaking diarrhea at its worst. For a city generating so much revenue, the infrastructure is in shambles. And to top that off, there are the concerted attempts to make the city worse by some groups for their vested interests. I mean WTF is wrong with people here. Do they not understand that by doing this they are just driving out the businesses that actually brought the boom to this city. I see a lot on people blaming the IT guys for raising the prices in the city by paying the exorbitant rents but if that was the case, why don't we see the same in Hyderabad or Gurgaon.\n\nBanning carpooling, really. I mean with such excellent public transport, obviously your main focus should be on getting more vehicles on the road. If they were actually serious about the reasons, they could have resolved the issue simply by ensuring that the apps confirm if the registered vehicles have insurance. Carpooling is not a service or a profession so the taxation argument is crap. What's next, you're going the tax the groceries that I split with my flatmates next. If anyone has any genuine arguments to say that this was a good idea, I'm all ears but honestly, I really do feel that this city is run  by goons and there is nothing that can be done about that. \n\n\nP.

I feel like unless you've been in the commnunity for a long time, you've forgotten some of OVK's greatest hits. Let's stroll down memory lane and revist when Payday 2 was the Dark Souls of Heist Games. (If you remember that quoute you qualify for a veterans discount)\n\n**PAYDAY 2 ON LAUNCH**\n\n\\-Payday 2 on launch had a bunch of just horribly unfun features that you probably might not have even known about. Before the continental or Gage, you were basically SOL getting mods. It was just random card drops. Good luck figuring out what any shit does for your guns since all the stats were sliders. Payday 2 on launch was trying so hard to be \"hardcore\" with things like rare Pro Jobs, that couldn't be rpeeated if they failed, which would be offered randomly on crimenet. As well, each heist had a chance to trigger an \"escape\" which was a really annoying holdout mission that could be tacked on to anything. Just finished 3 days of Rats? Sike! Do one more shitty level. It also was released missing a suprising amount of content --- the fucking Cloaker wasn't in launch!\n\n**BO ANDERSON**\n\nThis guy was Wolf's brother, and the CEO of Starbreeze, and more infamous than XVV. A ton of Payday's terrible choices could be linked back to him and David Goldfarb trying to design the game as the hardest heist game possible. They directly cited Dark Souls for some baffling reason. Anyway, Bo was notorious for going on Steam forums and calling out fans, with \"Your Opinion, My Choice\" being spouted a lot as his response to how flashbangs worked in base Payday 2. (they spawned at your feet and there was nothing you could do to combat them.) Bo said a lot of controversial shit over the years, and was ousted, but let's not forget him.\n\n**THE COMPLETELY OVERKILL PACK**\n\nOh boy. This doozy. If you weren't there for it, The COMPLETELY OVERKILL pack was a 20$ DLC pack that was limited and gave you \"ubercharged\" versions of the original gangs mask. It was obviously and intentionally overpriced with the thinking being that you were \"donating\" to Overkill to help devleop the game. Okay, I guess. Doesn't change that it was horrifically ovepriced and limited for no reason. You also got  SECRET item yet to be revealed, that would be revealed when a new mechanic was implemented! What did you get? A Loot Crate when they added microtransactions! Now that's OVERKILL!\n\n**CONSOLES**\n\nFor years, the PD2 experience on consoles was just broken. They added a few DLC, but afaik, capped it at Armored Transport. PC players got all sorts of cool new content, while if you bought it on 360 or PS3, you were legit shit out of luck.\n\nThe solution? Re-release it as the CRIMEWAVE edition for PS4 / XB1, which had the DLC up to about 2015. Great idea! Except they abandoned consoles *again.*  I can't speak to how updated the console versions of Payday 2 got, but as the game kept developing, the console versions were clearly not a priority, and it seemed disingenious that they were even being sold. Especially the Switch version, which was borderline unplayable.\n\n**CRIME FEST 2015**\n\n**Jesus christ.** To say this upset the community would be an understatement. Go check the top post of this subreddit and come back.\n\nCrime Fest 2015, we were promised a bunch of awesome things if we completed in game tasks. Last Crime Fest we saw the return of Hoxton, the fandom's at the time most beloved character before he got turned into a one note character. What did we get this time?The inclusion of **MICROTRANSACTIONS**, **LOOT CRATES AND SKINS THAT GAVE STAT BONUSES**. OVK had promised Payday would *never* include these features, and here they all were being presented to us as a reward for our work as a community. To say this left a bad taste in people's mouths would be drastically underselling it. This wasn't just the subreddit crying. This one was a huge deal. Tons of gaming publications ran stories on this -- pcgamer, polygon, IGN, it was unprecedented. OVK had basically destroyed \\*all\\* of the goodwill they accumulated in a single update.\n\n**THE WALKING DEAD**Did you know overkill made a walking dead game? You might not have because it was effectively delisted from every online marketplace. I never got a chance to play, but the game was so critically maligned and underperformed so drastically the game was scrubbed from the history books, causing OVK to nearly go bankrupt --- leading to\n\n**THE \"ULTIMATE\" EDITION OF PAYDAY 2 (OR NOT)**\n\nPayday 2 has some of the most outrageous DLC for a game possible, rivaled by things like Dead by Daylight or Train Simulator. If you wanted to keep up with the power creep, you needed the DLC. When One Down first dropped, the meta build required the crossbow from the stupid chivalry pack. People started getting annoyed that Payday had more DLC than game, so Overkill decided that it would restructure how Payday was sold! ALL DLC would be packed into Payday 2, and it would be redubbed the ULTIMATE edition, and all future Payday 2 DLC would be free. Except when TWD bombed, they renegged on this, and went right back to selling DLC. Aren't you glad we got Ethan and Hila?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love Payday. I will always love Payday.This subreddit is so angry right now, and deserved. But I see a lot of sucking up for Starbreeze, and I just wanted to remind the fandom, that studio has literally never been on our side. They don't need the defense brigade.","subreddit":"paydaytheheist","comments":192,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/16qc781/a_brief_trip_down_memory_lane_for_the_kind_of/"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-25","timestamp":1695649353,"title":"Homeless elder population worst since great depression.","text":"[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unconscionable-baby-boomers-becoming-homeless-103000310.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unconscionable-baby-boomers-becoming-homeless-103000310.html)\n\nSo I personally have dealt with this with a family member, they were silent generation and this was before COVID. \n\nI had a family member who got screwed over in a divorce in her late 60s, she was a stay-at-home mom, and worked some but only a small SS check $800 per month. The divorce was due to the husband spending all their assets on stupid stuff. They were also farmers so even when he died it only got her SS up to about 1k per month since farmers don't pay into SS. \n\nBottomline we used government services, but the backlog for elder housing with public assistance in 2017 was 2+ years. She does get Medicaid and food stamps which helps, but in the end the family including myself had to pay for her apartment, transport and utilities. She pays food, gas and incidentals. So we are spending over 2k per month all included.  \n\nWhat I have seen of older boomers is the majority do have pensions, but the ones who don't usually have little to no savings. They are under the delusion SS is enough, which at best was supposed to be 30% of the savings 3 legged stool of the 50-80s. The other 2 legs were pension and personal savings. Pensions are gone so your 401k/IRA/Savings is now 70% of the assumed retirement costs last I read. \n\nI am very concerned that the younger boomers who have only small pensions because they were frozen and may or may not have invested into 401k/403b/IRAs may be very under \"funded\" for retirement. Given the massive spike in costs in the past few years how are people on \"fixed\" incomes supposed to not be homeless?\n\nI am a late Gen X (1975) person but was taught financial literacy at a very young age so I did fine, but even with what I have saved I am still concerned given that by the time I retire, SS will be paying 70 cents on the dollar. \n\nFor the younger people take this as a warning, save early and save often because 1. Time moves a lot faster than you think. 2. Time (compounding interest) is the biggest weapon you have as a young person. I started saving the 15% max 401k at 28 (which sucked and I lived hard), but it also means at 48 I'm closing on my first million in my 401k.

I've been trying to find a way to make infographics using Midjourney, and it's near-impossible to *not* get that non-sensical fake-AI text if you say \"Infographic\"\n\nFor example, for the prompt: ***make an infographic with 5 empty boxes, green theme, environmentalist society, vectors in background --ar 2:1***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j4efhfywztnb1.png?width=1908&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b55716e7be95b4b1462cfa12b14801920a3e95f\n\nThose boxes are 1. not empty, 2. filled with fake text. I've tried a few things to make this work.  \n\n\n1. Use AI Text Remover apps, they hardly work yet, maybe in the future, but right now, they leave blotches of this fake text\n2. Use an upscaler and try AI Text Remover apps on all the cropped segments, this is too unnecessarily expensive, and still isn't a good solution.\n\nI even tried using so many different prompts, trying, BEGGING Chatgpt to write a prompt that Midjourney can understand, where I want **no** fake AI-text, but no luck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I had an idea, what if I just give it an plain image with boxes ? So I did, and then I stopped using terms like \"Infographic\", and \"No text\". Simply mentioned what you *do* want, as opposed to what you *don't* want.\n\nThis is an example of an image with plain boxes:[https://cdn.hero.page/grid-images/1-2-grid-shapes.png](https://cdn.hero.page/grid-images/1-2-grid-shapes.png)  \n\n\n[2 x 1 Grid](https://preview.redd.it/wc5jnugy0unb1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f32165ffb556088b0fbaea71e870f673553c96f)\n\nI used the prompt:\n\n    https://cdn.hero.page/grid-images/1-2-grid-shapes.png 2 empty shapes. surrounded by (Manga Characters, Long Hair Bubbles, Action Scenes) and Manga and Anime related vectors in the background which is a gradient of the colors Pink, Purple, Green, Blue. Image is full height and full width with no cropping. Leave the shapes empty with nothing inside, flat material vector design, 2D, illustration, background has illustration --ar 2:1\n\nand I upscaled this fricken masterpiece!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g1ltfu573unb1.png?width=1904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03283dc57f5ec8011b4646ebcdfd0971aaaf3018\n\nThis is the first time I've successfully generated a nice infographic ***template*** with no fake text, and I've been doing it like crazy.  \n\n\nHere's is the template of the prompt for Midjourney:\n\n    https://cdn.hero.page/grid-images/1-2-grid-shapes.png 2 empty shapes. Surrounded by ({{vectors}}) and {{keywords}} related vectors in the background which is a gradient of the colors {{colors}}. Image is full height and full width with no cropping. Leave the shapes empty with nothing inside, flat material vector design, 2D, illustration, background has illustration --ar 2:1\n\nYou can change this part \"flat material vector design, 2D, illustration\"  to match the theme you want.  \n\n\nYou can also get a list of all the [empty grid images I made here](https://hero.page/samir/plain-grid-images-variety-of-shapes).\n\nI uploaded a bunch of standard grids, asked ChatGPT to give me a list of industries and relevant factors. This is the prompt I use in ChatGPT for it to generate a Midjourney prompt for an infographic:\n\n    The template variables in the given string are {{vectors}}, {{keywords}}, and {{colors}}.  I want to create an infographic for Gaming. Come up with a list of 4 vectors, 2 word related keywords for Gaming like \"Headphones, Gaming keyboard\", and 3 colors that will make a nice gradient. These colors should be in simple english, like \"Dark red, blue\" etc. Not Hex colors.  \n    \n    Then, input those values into this template string, and return the full string in plain text: \n    ``` https://cdn.hero.page/grid-images/1-2-grid-shapes.png 2 empty shapes. Surrounded by ({{vectors}}) and {{keywords}} related vectors in the background which is a gradient of the colors {{colors}}. Image is full height and full width with no cropping. Leave the shapes empty with nothing inside, flat material vector design, 2D, illustration, background has illustration --ar 2:1 \n    ```\n\nFeel free to update these to match your case. You can make your own simple grid images too for different sized infographics, but I have use the following Aspect Ratio sizes (standard in design industry):  \n\n\n* 1:1: Square\n* 4:3: Standard Screen\n* 3:4: Vertical, Standard\n* 2:3: Vertical, Alternative\n* 5:4: Golden Ratio, Close Approximation\n* 6:1: Long Horizontal Banner\n* 1:2: Vertical, Half Length\n* 2:1: Horizontal, Half Height\n* 5:3: Custom Widescreen\n\nThe reason I made so many is so I have an unlimited collection of BASIC infographics templates, because now, instead of using empty boxes, I can use SAMPLE infographics to generate even better ones. This one below is generated with the image i generated above!  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pfbodpwy6unb1.png?width=1888&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6022b662738e69cde3dd3a047bc95cdcb75b43d\n\nOf course, you'll get better results with simple, plain grid images.  \n\n\nHere are all the infographic templates I made. All free &amp; personal use. I guess they're commercial use too, as in you can hopefully promote your products using them, but please, people always try to package these free resources and sell them on Gumroad, etc., **please don't**. I know this won't stop you, but just think about it =-c\u000f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere they all are, categorized (somewhat) **they all have the Hex color codes found in the images, too:** \n\n## Technology\n\n|Infographic Category|Subcategories &amp;

We live in a fairly safe neighborhood, but during the night there are some sketchy drunk men hanging around who also scare me quite honestly. My gf however wasn't really scared to walk alone at night and would say that she's just as strong as those men and can take care of herself. My gf is 5'10\" and works out 2 times a week. She's indeed very strong compared to most women, but she was obviously delusional to think that her strength was comparable to that of an average man. She would even go as far as saying that if someone should be worried for walking alone at night then it should be me as I'm a scrawny 5'9\" man. I thought this was one of the situations where it would be better to just shut up than being correct, so I mostly stopped showing my concerns to her.  \n\nYesterday she went out with some of her friends and called me at 1am that she'll come alone via public transportation (she doesn't have a license). I told her that it's dangerous and I should come pick her up, but she insisted on coming by herself. I couldn't sleep till she came home an hour later. She was so angry at me for not trusting her that she can take care of herself. That was when I decided to demonstrate her the disparity between the strength of men and women. She thought I was joking at first but when she realized that I was dead serious, she happily took the opportunity to prove how wrong I was. I basically told her to ground me as hard as she can, and then I quickly got out of her grip and grounded her for several minutes till she surrendered. She cried a lot throughout this whole time and I could also see the fear in her eyes, even though she knew very well that I would never hurt her. I humiliated her. I slept on the couch that night. She didn't want to talk about it in the morning and said that she's fine, but she's still obviously very upset about it. I feel horrible that I've shattered her confidence like that, and I don't think she will ever feel safe walking alone at night again. I'm probably a really horrible person for doing that and I wish I could had just trusted her more to take care of herself. I know this relationship is probably over, but is there anything I could do to make up for it?  \n\ntl;dr: I demonstrated to my gf the disparity between the strength of men and women trying teach her a lesson. I humiliated and shattered her confidence in the process and feel terrible for what I did. Can I do something to make up for it?  \n\nEDIT: I can't possibly answer all of your comments. What I did was an assault, I admit it. I can't express how sorry I am for doing that. I thought I was doing the right thing, but instead I assaulted her by trying to prevent exactly that. Don't learn from me, but please keep yourself safe out there, if not for you, then for the ones who love you.  \n\n**Relevant comments:**  \n\nThe fuck did I just read.  \n\nYou harmed and terrified your girlfriend to win an argument?  \n\n..  \n\nThe problem is you proved your point and then took it too far.. you shouldn\u0019t have made her cry in fact you only needed to show her she couldn\u0019t hold you down. You need some self reflection  \n\n..\n\n&gt;even though she knew very well that I would never hurt her.\n\nI mean...you pinned her to the ground for multiple minutes while she was crying and terrified. Sorry but \"I would never hurt you\" rings pretty hollow after that. You didn't humiliate her, you traumatized her. Whatever your intention, what you did comes across very much as a threat. \"Remember when you think you're strong that I can easily hurt you if I want\" is not a loving or protective message.  \n\nHonestly there's nothing you can do except give her time and perhaps write out a genuine apology acknowledging how wrong your actions were. She has to decide whether or not she trusts you and feels safe with you going forward. I do understand not wanting her to walk home alone at night, but I can't for the life of me understand why you thought THIS was the way to convey your concern. You need to do some introspection to figure out why you thought this was appropriate so you can assure her nothing like this will ever happen again.  \n\n..  \n\n\u001cI think all men are rapist so I showed my partner how easily I could rape her&for her own protection of course.\u001d\n\nYou can\u0019t make it up to her.\n\nOk. That\u0019s wrong. Some men could re-establish trust after a mistake like this, but you still think you are right. You have to break down all the entitlements that brought you to this reasoning. To the idea that \u001cteaching her a lesson\u001d was anything other then emotional and physical abuse. That you had the right.\n\nSo you got some work to do and it\u0019s unfair to ask her to rehabilitate you.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...  \n\n**Update (June 2023)**  \n\nIt's been two and a half months since my original post, and I thought it'd be appropriate to give you an update after some recent events. I actually already tried to do an update a few days later, but I was such a wreak mentally and deleted it shortly after.  \n\nSo I'll get straight to the point, she broke up with me the next day over the phone. She wanted me to admit that I enjoyed seeing her cry, but I kept defending myself till she gave up. But deep down I knew that she was right. I'm not ashamed to say now that I was a bit aroused by overpowering her so easily and seeing her cry. I know how horrible it sounds, and I'm definitely not proud of it, but I think that acknowledging my flaws and being open about them is the first step in overcoming them. The next few days after the break up were probably some of the worst days in my life. I thought that I've lost everything, including my self respect. I decided to go to therapy and take a break from dating for the foreseeable future. Luckily, I also had the support of my family and close friends, even if they didn't fully agree with my actions.  \n\nFor those of you who say that she needed a reality check, I have to disagree with you on this one. Yes, she overestimated her strength, but she's not dumb enough to actually engage in a fight with a stranger, let alone a drunk man. Being cautious has nothing to do with strength, and now I believe that she was also right to get a bit mad at me for having little to no faith in her. Trying to demonstrate how much stronger I was at 2am was just plain stupid though.  \n\nI haven't heard from my ex till she gave me a call two days ago. We barely talked about the incident though, it was mostly just catching up and making peace with each other. She's doing pretty great actually. She's about to graduate with her masters and already has a job lined up. She started dating a new guy last month, and I can tell by the way she talked that she's very into him. She signed up for a swing class (which is something that she wanted to do for the longest time but didn't do it because of me), which is also where she met her new bf. What she didn't do however is to sign up for a self defense class, which honestly I kind of expected. Overall I was glad to hear how happy she sounded. I'm also doing pretty good myself, although I'm still on my break from dating and I don't see myself getting into another relationship for at least a year.  \n\nLast month I also got to experience how my ex felt when I was overly worried for her safety. I went with my family to a trip in Naples, and while we had our apartment in a fairly safe part of the city, it was just a few blocks away from some sketchy alleys during the night. So when I craved for a good pizza (in a specific place) during one of the nights there, my mom got very vocal about not wanting me to go to that place because of how sketchy some of the alleys on the way there looked like. I tried to convince her that she has nothing to worry about but to no avail, and then it dawned on me that this is probably how my ex felt when I expressed my concerns to her. Eventually, I decided to go to that place the next day during daytime instead. Was definitely worth it though.  \n\nI'm genuinely happy with how things went for both of us, although I still miss her sometimes, and hearing her voice again just made me miss her even more. But I know that it'd probably be better for us to just move on with our lives separately. I also plan to continue with my therapy sessions, even though I feel completely fine by now. The reason is very simple, it's just to have someone that I can talk to without feeling judged. Reddit isn't really the best place for that as you could probably tell from my original post, but I still want to thank everyone who commented and gave their opinion.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Relevant comments:**  \n\n\u001cI was a bit aroused by overpowering her so easily and seeing her cry.\u001d\n\nThat\u0019s a hectic statement to make my dude. I\u0019m at a loss of words.. Definitely seeing a therapist for those type of dark thoughts is a good idea.  \n\n..  \n\nUnfortunately learning your lesson can be a very, very bitter pill to swallow. It's great that you saw how you fucked up and hopefully you can explore the power fantasy or restraint stuff you're supposedly into in a healthier way from now on.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...  \n\n**I am not OOP.

Here's another list about stuff I found, most of it is very easy to miss when watching the leaks.\n\nI know there's already a 60 page document about the leak. But I'm having fun scraping details together in my own way to compile a list to share with you in a short and readable way, sometimes with my own thoughts attached to it.\n\nThat means there's more to read this time. And as always, add one grain of salt to your salt sprinkler.\n\nHere goes nothing:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) The file size of the dev build was possibly around 80 GB big. My very personal guess is, we can expect just under 200 GB as the final file size because dev builds often only have specific features active which are currently needed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) There are safes. One is in the back of an office. I assume those can most likely be picked and/or opened in other ways. Fits perfectly into the new stealth system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) Underwater weapon aiming is coming. So is directional swimming (you can swim backwards or to the side while aiming).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4) Vehicles lean and move similar to GTA 4 when braking, turning or speeding up. Vehicle physics feel like a mix between GTA 4 and GTA 5.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5) Walking around with an openly carried gun could be enough to already alert people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6) Public transport has those \"Rate your ride\" QR-codes. Given how advanced the player cellphones seem to be, we could be able to scan those. If that's also true, it hints towards a very expanded ingame internet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7) The Vice City Metro seems to have three lines, spanning over \\~24 stations. Even different kind of train cars depending on the line:\n\n* Light Blue stands for \"Vice City Metro M(unreadable)\" It seems to cover the Vice City central area.\n* Dark Blue stands for \"VCIA - Vice City International (unreadable (airport?))\". It seems to cover one half of the city, maybe even leaves the city to some extent.\n* There's also a yellow line. It goes the opposite way from the dark blue line, probably covering the other half of the city.\n* There may also be a gray line which is a regional/international train.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n8) Obviously, all Rockstar studios are working together on this project. Found animation work from Rockstar North, Toronto, Dundee and India.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n9) Credit Cards called \"Shark\" seem to be a thing. Fleeca is also back, plus at least two more which I can't see well enough to name them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10) It's pretty clear what Jasons special ability will be: Marking things of importance during a robbery. I saw jewelry, a safe and a security camera being marked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n11) You can buy gum from gumball machines.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n12) Found a mention of the USA and Canada on a sign and heard the \"Eiffel Tower\" being mentioned in a radio. Surprisingly many real world names. Nothing new in the GTA universe however.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n13) Wi-Fi hotspots. If it's not decoration only I can imagine there being such a system in the game. Fits well into the expanded cell phone/internet thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n14) If you commit a robbery, cops won't show up immediately. It takes time for them to be dispatched.\n\n* If this counts for all kind of crimes and not only robberies, the Wi-Fi/cellphone signal thing could mean, rural crimes are less likely to be reported. Similar to the witness system in RDR2.\n* Robberies and heists will now feel much more like actual robberies because of this.\n* You can communicate with the cops or do cop-related actions as soon as they arrive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n15) Excavators can possibly be driven!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n16) Shooting someone in the head could sometimes still make them move around in a gruesome and way too realistic way before they bleed out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n17) Not only hotels, but also inns could be a place to stay at.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n18) Found an US, Canada and Mexico flag next to each other. They are next to the \"Vice City Neighborhood Enhance(unreadable) Community Center\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n19) I seriously think the map will be bigger than we think. Here are the reasons:\n\n* Mexico and Canada can be found being mentioned or displayed multiple times.\n* Many hints towards a big water part of the map.\n* Other people found out, that the map isn't very big by itself according to the W/E coordinates found in the leaks. That means there's a high possibility for more to see in the northern/southern parts or even **beyond the coast**.\n* The whole projects codename is \"Americas\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n20) Finland doesn't exist. ¯\\\\\\_(Ä)\\_/¯\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n21) Flashbangs, flashlights.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n22) Lions or Tigers exist. Probably only caged.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n23) One event is called \"Police Siren Abuse\". Leaves much room for speculation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n24) Saw someone talking some good news about a person and another person giving a positive response about it. More conversations between NPCs?\n\n* And another: Person 1: \"How's it going?\" Person 2: \"Going badly.\" Person 3: (negative response) Person 4: (response closer negative) Person 5: (conversation\\_line\\_4)\n   * Means that bigger groups of NPC people may form and talk to each other in a way which makes sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n25) Lucia will duck around 40 % lower than Jason if I interpreted correctly what I just saw. Maybe a little far-fetched.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n26) The \"(Vice City) Mambas\" will be a sports team.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n27) Cars will behave differently on tarmac, dirt, deep dirt, gravel, deep gravel and grass. Those are the only confirmed ones, there's surely more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n28) A spear gun will most likely be usable. While regular weapons aren't that effective underwater, a spear gun is. Another hint towards more underwater content.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n29) GPS tracker jammers will be a thing which are carriable via inventory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n30) Same thing with an \"immobilizer bypass\". An immobilizer is an electronic security device fitted to a motor vehicle that prevents the engine from being started unless the correct key is present and it prevents the car from being hot wired.\n\n* It probably won't be that easy anymore to steal a parked sports car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n31) More things we can carry: An auto dialer, a cut-off tool, binoculars, fire extinguishers, pool cues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n32) Beef jerkys in your pants.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n33) Golf balls, golf irons, golf wedges, gold putters, golf drivers. I guess golf is back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n34) When the player sat onto a bike, a text popped up saying \"Discovered Sanches (livery). Means we'll probably be able to \"discover\" vehicles in some way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n35) Assuming vanilla unicorn is back as a strip club brand, I found a second unreadable one and a third brand name called \"Horny's\". More strip clubs, it seems. EDIT: False alarm! Horny's is a burger place. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n36) The player has his own inventory, but there's also a shared inventory between characters.\n\n* If Lucia is your partner, you can put a weapon and a few snacks into that inventory to make them usable for her as an example. I assume that's how it works.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n37) In one clip the map only shows up after the player gets into a car. Maybe we won't have a permanent mini map.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n38) There will be \"Serializable World Events\". Means some world events could have different stages to them.\n\n* Those could function like the blue man icons on the minimap from GTA 4 or Strangers and Freaks from GTA 5. Only that they are world events.

I came up with this idea a year ago and was not expecting to talk about it today. As we see here, that has led to confusion, panic, and ill feelings. Consider my explanation, and please keep the discussion civil.\n\nLet me be the first to say that **Mango got some things wrong**. By all interpretations of what he said, it sounds like the US dropped chemical weapons on its ally Britain and threw soldiers into the sea to be evil for the sake of it. This is not the case.\n\nInstead, the US used a limited amount of herbicide agents against the **southeast** in a failed operation to disrupt German logistics during Sealion. The thought is that by creating a temporary supply crisis, the US might buy time to extend its defense and evacuation. The plan fails, Germany wins, and **British agriculture thrives**. Not, as Mango says, long-lasting damage. We wanted to reveal this piece of lore in an event about a child growing up with the after-effects of LN-8 in a rural water supply. This is not some major campaign to toxify Britain but one of a hundred desperate bids to save British evacuees from an otherwise doomed island.\n\nFor those who do not know, LN-8 is a herbicide agent developed during WW2 for use against Japan during the lead-up to a hypothetical invasion. This chemical is known for being the precursor to Agent Orange, but LN-8 is much less potent and needs a high concentration to do long-term damage. This concentration would not be possible during Sealion's duration, not to mention the time spent transporting the LN-8 to Iceland and Britain.\n\nAs for the refugees on the ship, the US's goal during Sealion was initially to defend the island, but when it was obvious the Allies could never retake Britain, their strategy shifted to evacuating as many residents as possible to Canada and the United States. Inevitably, however, the US could not evacuate everybody, and as the Germans approached the final port, desperation escalated. Hundreds of thousands of Britons escaped the islands during the evacuation, but during the last panicked days, I think it's inevitable people would be turned away, try to get on overladen ships anyways, and be kicked off by passengers and crew. This wouldn't be a systemic thing US forces are doing, and it's a one-time tragedy we're depicting to underscore the desperation of evacuation.\n\nUS policy would be to evacuate as many refugees as possible, but what I am describing has historical precedence in the evacuations of South Vietnam, Phnom Penh, Kabul, and more. We wanted to reveal this lore in an event about one of the people left behind welcoming HMMLR during the Civil War. We want to depict these events because they have historical precedence, but we aren't doing this arbitrarily. I hope you'll see that this depiction is more grounded and more acceptable than what might have been previously assumed to be the case.\n\nThe whole premise of a successful Operation Sealion requires considerable handwaving logic and history, and even if these lore additions are imperfect, I hope you can appreciate them as our attempt to flesh out the scenario in US lore beyond just \"the Nazis invaded and won, and now these exiles exist.\" Ideally, we want to characterize these exiles for Britain and USA/OFN content.\n\nI want to avoid some of the accusatory language and unwarranted hostility I saw in the last thread. I hope you can see I am not making these additions arbitrarily, and I am not trying to subvert any public trust, I just want to write a fun scenario.

She does not drive. Its too much work and makes her anxious. It used to be fine since she usually work from home and goes out only once every couple of weeks for grocery shopping or for client meetings.\n\nBut since her husband left, she has been calling me to go hang out with her. We live 30 mins away. She wants me to take her baby shopping, furniture shopping, help remodel her home, bring her out whenever she has cravings, rub her foot, help her with chores when she is too tired etc. I don't want to. \n\nFirst of all : Shopping has never been my thing. Walking for hours looking at different things is just exhausting to me. I am a internet buyer.I told her that she can maybe ask one of her friends. But since she basically was burrowed at home for the past 4 years, she is not in touch with her friends. Our parents live 3 hour away. \n\nI told her she can wait and take mom with her then. She wants me to drive mom here since mom refuses to take public transport or drive here. Dad does not want to drive her here in his off days. \n\nI said its same for me. I dont want to spend my off days driving them around either. (Mom would not stay here since she has work back home). \n\nI am already the one taking my sister to her appointments.

Americans love one thing as much as a Big Mac, and that is FUCKING TRAVELING. Wether it's by plane, car, train... Americans travel like hell. Not only that but commuting is a reality and hopefully with more remote work this eases. \n\nWe also have an outdated af grid system. The grid system will require trillions of dollars and decades to even make a dent to modernize.\n\nAs a result, I think plug-in hybrids are the answer at least for now until battery tech changes drastically. But let's think about it, most PHEVs are starting to get into the 40-50 mile range in pure EV mode which is more than enough for the common folk commuting to work or going out for errands or weekend fun.

Lots of cycle paths, wide sidewalks, lots of greenery, accommodation with photovoltaic panels, heat pumps, frames/double glazing and argon inside windows and thick external walls with thermal coats.\n\nHowever, cars are not banned from this neighborhood (unlike in the center of my city), they simply have a slightly smaller street with raised pedestrian crossings and few parking spaces. That said, even if there were zero parking spaces, the neighborhood is not large and is surrounded by streets full of parking spaces. Furthermore, many residents have a garage and/or at least one private parking space.\n\nYesterday, however, speaking to my neighbor he complained that there are few parking spaces and that when they finish the neighborhood and there are even more people here there will be even fewer parking spaces.\n\nIt's not a neighbor I know well (otherwise he would have known that I don't even own a car, I only get around by push scooter or bike) and when I told him that I thought there were more than enough he almost attacked me. He also asked me \"where will you put the car when there will be so many of us\"? But without wanting to wait for me to tell him my answer.\n\nThis really left me amazed, it is literally less than 500 meters to reach any street near the next street full of parking, the streets around the neighborhood are classic streets with continuous parking along the entire side of the road... only inside the neighborhood there are few free parking spaces but in any case the majority of residents have already purchased at least 1 private car park if not even a garage.\n\nIt made me realize that many are not even willing to walk 300 meters. Not even with nice walking facilities. They want to have parking under their house and even attack people verbally if they think you want to take away this right from them (or even refuse to use it, my father was there and he \"dared\" to say that he will leave the car outside... my neighbor was shocked \"you will never find a parking space here... Why didn't you buy a private parking space?\"). Not only that, I thought whoever bought here was very environmentally friendly like me. After all, the houses (or rather apartments/condos) here are expensive but not large because they use a whole series of methods to avoid losing heat and save energy. I thought it was obvious that there were fewer people interested in cars, but that's not the case at all, most of them are just rich people that want to show off their new thing....\n\nAnd this happens here, in a town with decent public transport and neighborhoods like this and the center that are much more pedestrian than car centric.\n\nYesterday I said to myself, there is no hope... Then I said to myself that maybe logic isn't a good way to change people's mentality.\n\nWhat solutions do you think are effective?\n\nPersonally speaking the only one that comes to mind is forcing people by banning cars or making them pay so much that they are forced to choose between having a car and having a house.

I was standing in an aisle choosing what to buy, making sure there was plenty of room on the other side for people to get past. This boomer-aged guy walks right up to me, stops as if expecting me to move, and I just motion to him to walk around. It wasn't busy and there was nobody else around so he could've just walked past. He tuts, shakes his head and makes a *big* show of 'squeezing past' (there was plenty of space). No 'excuse me' or anything.

Not gonna lie, women also do this, but 1. far less often and 2. for different reasons - it's usually because they weren't paying attention/didn't notice, rather than actually seeing me then expecting me to move the way men do.

Kpop groups are well known for having legions of incredibly dedicated fans, who are willing to go above and beyond for their idols. One thing that brings a lot of fans of the same group together is shipping. If you're not familiar with the concept of shipping, I'm honestly impressed. The kind of shipping we'll be talking about here is the shipping of real people (also known as RPF). In Kpop, this usually manifests as fans really liking the relationship between two (usually male) K-pop idols, and then thinking they should fuck. There's a lot of popular Kpop ships out there, and they all have their own devoted group of supporters. But today we're gonna be talking about the Kpop ship that would go on to define Kpop fanservice, fandom, and shipping for the next two decades: Yunjae.\n\n*Disclaimer: I do not ship Yunjae. I have never shipped Yunjae. This is not an essay on why I believe Yunjae is real. I am not Korean, I do not speak Korean, and I was not into TVXQ when all of this occurred. I have done my best to make sure all my information is sourced and legit, and to specify when it is not or when there may be translation errors. I am also not writing this to try and say every Yunjae shipper is as I have described or vilify shippers. I just want to detail some of the insanity that Yunjae shippers helped perpetuate.*\n\n**Background information**\n\nBefore we can get into what Yunjae even is, we need to talk about the group our leading men debuted in: [**TVXQ!.**](https://imgur.com/a/Jws41oX) **TVXQ** is an acronym for *Tong Vfang Xien Qi*, which means \"rising gods of the east\" in Chinese. In Korea they're referred to as Dong Bang Shin Ki, or DBSK. In Japan they are known as Tohoshinki, or THSK. All of these names mean the same thing, and for consistency's sake I'll just be referring to them as TVXQ throughout this, unless I'm specifically talking about their activities in Japan.\n\nTVXQ debuted as a 5-member boy group in 2003, with their first performance being at[ a Britney spears showcase, of all places](https://youtu.be/sWWkeSAtZEI?si=BEy1ZqLjaTik1stR&amp;t=3412). [This write-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/hrgzss/kpop_the_most_divided_kpop_fandom_tvxq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) does a really good job of explaining their history as well as their eventual fate, and I strongly recommend looking at it. I'll do my best to sum up what you need to know about TVXQ in order to understand what's to come:\n\n* At debut, the members of TVXQ were, in Lastname (*Stagename*(s)) **Firstname** format:\n\no [Kim (*Xiah/Xia*) **Junsu**](https://imgur.com/a/qqsoJZq)\n\no [Park (*Micky*) **Yoochun**](https://imgur.com/a/HBUlXya)\n\no [Kim (*Hero/Youngwoong*) **Jaejoong**](https://imgur.com/a/BxHCVTp)\n\no [Shim (*MAX/Choikang*) **Changmin**](https://imgur.com/a/sj9Uqlk)\n\no [Jung *(U-know*) **Yunho**](https://imgur.com/a/oXFDHdF)\n\n* Yes, they *do* have a lot of stage names. Yes, they *do* go by all of them. Because I don't hate whoever is reading this *that* much, I'll just stick to using their first names.\n* TVXQ tend to stand in the [same order](https://thebiaslistcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/tvxq-hug.jpg?w=640) in [group photos](https://i.imgur.com/l5pCWrM.jpg), which is the same order I've listed the members in. Jaejoong is nearly always in the [middle](https://i.discogs.com/P8gzSc6VjPkKzuSbOYzaCSSOuRL3GB3iaGOlzyk2aGU/rs:fit/g:sm/q:90/h:595/w:600/czM6Ly9kaXNjb2dz/LWRhdGFiYXNlLWlt/YWdlcy9SLTk5MjU0/MzktMTQ4ODY1MjMy/OS0zODEyLmpwZWc.jpeg), with Yunho being the last person on the [right](https://i.imgur.com/6WzR4Xf.jpg).\n* TVXQ's fanbase is known as **Cassiopeia**, or as **Cassies** for short. Cassies are well, *well* known for being one of the more batshit insane Kpop fandoms. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/bz6jhc/kpop_tvxq_and_the_absolute_worst_sasaengs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) does a great job listing some of the more egregious things Cassiopeia have done across the years, just to give you an idea of the kind of fanbase they're known for being. Cassies are constantly fighting, even now.\n* TVXQ debuted under the company **SM Entertainment**, which is known as one of the \"big 3\" entertainment companies in Kpop. What you need to know about SM is they have resources, connections, and a very unfortunate eye for talent. In order to debut, each member of TVXQ had to sign a contract with SM agreeing to certain terms for a certain length of time.\n\nOkay, that's enough info dumping. Let's talk about what we came here for: gay ship fandom drama. Let's talk about Yunjae.\n\n# 2003-2005: The Beginning of an Era\n\n**Yunjae** is the ship name of TVXQ members [Yunho](https://i.imgur.com/fLLy2Us.jpg) and [Jaejoong](https://i.imgur.com/x2izCZR.jpg). Jaejoong and Yunho are the two oldest members of TVXQ, respectively, with their birthdays being just days apart. Jaejoong and Yunho had already been good friends prior to their debut in TVXQ, which is not always the case in Kpop. There's a lot of stories about how Yunho and Jaejoong originally met, with the most popular one claiming that they first encountered each other in a street fight. However, I have been able to find no evidence of this in English at least, so it's most likely just a rumor.\n\nRegardless of how they met, the important thing is that Yunho and Jaejoong were already friendly and close with each other when TVXQ was debuting. And at a time when most of the other members were still a bit awkward with each other, Yunjae's [level of comfort with each other](https://imgur.com/RVTbMxt) really stood out to people.  Fans rapidly picked up on their [closeness](https://imgur.com/Hdqf9wG), which wasn't hard when you had incidents like [Jaejoong kissing Yunho on the cheek on broadcast](https://media.tenor.com/rlRCGubqs8gAAAAM/angai313-yunjae.gif) in early 2004. Things quickly spiraled from there, as fans began to latch on to every subsequent interaction Yunho and Jaejoong would have with each other.\n\nFrom late 2004, when they released their first album *Tri-angle* (which featured some [truly unfortunate styling](https://imgur.com/a/DlxVsfL)) through the release of their second album [*Rising Sun*](https://imgur.com/a/ScuKnx3) at the end of 2005, Yunjae continued to grow in popularity as a ship. Fansites were beginning to pop up devoted exclusively to talking about Yunjae, capturing Yunjae moments, and stalking Yunjae. There's two very notable fanbases that are going to be important: **Yoonjaepaetch** (**YJP**), the largest Korean based Yunjae fansite, and **YoonJaeLoveBar** (**YJLB**), based out of China and the largest Yunjae fansite by far. These fansites became cornerstones of the fandom, because they had by far the most access to resources and had the most ability to get photos of Yunjae.\n\nAll the while, Yunho and Jaejoong continued to interact (relatively) normally with each other. They just happened to be two guys in a group who were very comfortable with each other. Their dynamic at this point was frequently characterized as them being the mom and dad of the group, due to Jaejoong's love for cooking and Yunho being the leader of the group. Nothing insane. Yet.\n\nTVXQ was becoming increasingly popular throughout this, which means that by the end of 2005, Yunjae had become a somewhat well-known ship in Kpop. Shipping in Kpop wasn't unheard of before this, and there had been fan favorite ships before Yunjae, but these ships had *nothing* on what Yunjae was about to become.\n\n# 2006: Where Things Get Real.\n\nThe year: 2006. The event: a competition hosted by SM entertainment to find the best TVXQ fanfiction. The prize: 1 million won, the possibility for the winner's fanfiction to become a live action drama, and a *date with TVXQ* *themselves.* Yes, you heard that right. [2006 starts with SM hosting an official fanfiction competition where the grand prize was a date with the guys who the fanfiction was about](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/n68aja/sm_fanfic_contest_no_it_actually_happened/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Am I the only one who thinks that's an incredibly bad idea? Just me? We never found out how that went, but I can only assume the answer is terribly, for everyone involved.\n\nAnyways, the existence of this competition shows that by early 2006, SM was catching on to the growing popularity of Yunjae, or at least shipping in general. Realizing that it was drawing a lot of new people into the group, SM did the only logical thing a corporation in a homophobic country in the mid 2000s could do: immediately milk Yunjae for all it was worth. This is how *Dangerous Love* came to be.\n\n**What's Dangerous Love?**\n\n***Dangerous Love*** is half the reason I wanted to write this thing in the first place. *Dangerous Love* is a fever dream. *Dangerous Love* changed everything.\n\nDangerous Love is an episode of the series [*Banjun Drama*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjun_Drama?useskin=vector),or *Reverse Drama* in English. Each episode of *Banjun Drama* was a stand alone mini-drama episode, with celebrity guests invited on to, as Wikipedia put it, \"...act in a very humorous and sarcastic way not seen in regular dramas.\" Think of each episode as if an SNL skit and a Kdrama had a child, and you're on the right path. You can probably tell where this is going---TVXQ were the celebrity guests on an episode, and that episode was *Dangerous Love*.\n\n**But why do we care about Dangerous Love?**\n\nTo understand why we care about *Dangerous Love*, we need to watch *Dangerous Love*. [Dangerous Love is best experienced in its original 480p resolution](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4dwo5w). But for those of you who don't want to watch a 45 minute long episode in Korean, I'll try to sum up the plot:\n\nYunho shows Jaejoong gay fanfiction of the two of them (*Dangerous Love* has TVXQ acting as themselves). Jaejoong reads the gay fanfiction. Jaejoong imagines himself and Yunho as he reads the gay fanfiction. If you watch a single thing from *Dangerous Love*, [watch this](https://youtu.be/jiP2_rZ1TeI?si=Qj3kDH0-g8Te8o0A&amp;t=151). Afterwards, Yunho starts being weirdly nice to Jaejoong, convincing Jaejoong that Yunho is gay for him. The rest of the episode consists of Yunho being nice while Jaejoong is unable to think of anything but him and Yunho being gay together. Sexy music plays every time they interact from now on.\n\nYunho tells Jaejoong that he needs to confess something to him. Jaejoong cuts him off, tells him he understands his feelings, and then gives him the world's least intimate hug. This confuses Yunho, because he is not in fact gay for Jaejoong. He's been acting nice because he broke Jaejoong's new camera. Jaejoong cusses him out, chases him around, everyone laughs, and the episode ends with no actual gay wrongs having been committed. That's *Dangerous Love*.\n\nThis would be insane to film and air anywhere in South Korea in 2006, but just to make sure we are all on the same page about how absurd this is, I need to clarify that *Dangerous Love* aired on *national television*. On a Sunday morning, in a timeslot that was consistently the #1 most watched program on Sundays in the nation. *Dangerous Love* aired to [13.8% viewership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Sunday?useskin=vector#2006). Millions of people, moms, dads, grandparents, watched this gay episode when it aired on TV.\n\nLet's circle back to the part where real life Yunho and Jaejoong have to act out a gay fanfiction of the two of them. Do you notice [the red phone booth Yunho pushes Jaejoong up against](https://imgur.com/a/I2NqAaA)? Thanks to *Dangerous Love*, red phonebooths have since become [highly associated with Yunjae](https://oyunjae.tumblr.com/post/158281846722/%EC%9E%AC%EC%A4%91%EC%95%84-%EC%9D%B4-%EC%95%88-%EC%97%90-%EB%84%88-%EC%9E%88%EB%8B%A4-jaejoong-ah-in-here), to the point where fans have [cosplayed as one to one of Jaejoong's concerts](https://yunjaepouch.tumblr.com/post/158310120331/oyunjae-the-red-phone-booth-jaejoong-chose-hahaha).\n\nAfter this, when people thought of TVXQ, a lot of them would then think about Yunjae. SM was promoting this ship on a national level. And it was working. Dangerous Love was the spark that would ignite the Yunjae Yaoi Inferno of 2006.\n\n**The Yunjae Yaoi Inferno of 2006.**\n\n*Dangerous Love* has aired, and SM has realized they have a verifiable cash cow on their hands in the form of Yunjae. So they start pushing Yunjae, and pushing it hard. \"Pushing\" a ship refers to when a higher power (TV show writers, authors, CEO of SM/[ex-international fugitive](https://www.asianjunkie.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/LeeSooManSuhSeWonInterpol.jpg) Lee Sooman) heavily promote and take steps to try and make a pairing a fan favorite. In Kpop in particular, this usually manifests in idols being told to up the fanservice and skinship with each other. And the reason they are told to do this, and the ways in which they are told to do this, stem from the way Yunjae began to interact from this point on.\n\nBecause *holy shit* did the amount of [touching,](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bd/4e/ad/bd4ead0afaa3c19d98e03c3223e8bcba.gif)  [looking,](https://media.tenor.com/YcQVrPNfj_8AAAAM/angai313-dbsk.gif)  and suggestive comments between Yunho and Jaejoong escalate during this year. And yes, it's obvious that a lot of this was instigated by SM telling them to [amp up the fanservice](https://rawrboysmodemedia.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/0001e87aad2.gif). The thing is that it was *also* obvious that not all of it *was* just fanservice. The reason Yunjae grew so popular was because it wasn't all just for show---you could tell Yunho and Jaejoong genuinely cared about each other as people and as friends on and off camera. So now you have amped up fanservice on camera, combined with acts done \"off camera\" that can be used to argue it's not all for show, and you have a recipe for a whole bunch of fans who genuinely and sincerely believe Yunjae are a real thing.\n\nNot every shipper truly believes that their ship is actually dating behind the scenes, and I'd say these days those fans are in the majority. People ship now because they like dynamics, like to imagine what could happen if they were dating. This was not the case with Yunjae. This was never the case with Yunjae. And why wouldn't it be, when in 2006 alone you had:\n\n* The aforementioned *Dangerous Love.*\n* Yunho and Jaejoong doing... [whatever this is](https://youtu.be/se0opm3nVPQ?si=83MIJba5F3uJOFpL&amp;t=61) on national TV. \"Grinding while hanging from monkey bars\" is the best way I can describe it and yet it still doesn't feel right. Speaking of grinding, what the fuck was going on [here](https://i.makeagif.com/media/2-22-2014/Ngi2XB.gif)?\n* [This photoshoot](https://imgur.com/a/1Ioh0iX). This is one of the times where the order they stand in has changed. Which they did so that Jaejoong and Yunho could... do that?? [Do this](https://ic.pics.livejournal.com/yunjaeandme/48592291/6637/original.gif)?? I don't know. Looking at it makes me laugh every time though.\n* [Lots](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7b/34/0d/7b340da9c407774ba928adc6244b2276.gif) and [lots](https://i.makeagif.com/media/7-09-2019/BcmXvl.gif) and [lots](https://media.tenor.com/vP3JNAJhyK4AAAAM/hug-yun-jae.gif) of the aforementioned touching and [looking](https://twitter.com/i/status/1349627864958734336).\n* Like, this is nowhere *near* all of it. I've been trying to avoid video links but just know that if you search Yunjae moment on YouTube, at least half are going to be from this year alone.\n* It was rumored that Yunho picked Jaejoong up from the police station after [Jaejoong had a DUI](https://forums.soompi.com/topic/13911-jaejoong-gets-caught-for-drunk-driving/) (his only one to date, I should add). This was another case where I could not find any solid English proof beyond a [single photo](https://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h220/azn_lil_babe/YunJaeHo/Candid202848029.jpg) and a lot of people repeating the same thing, so take that with a grain of salt.\n* *Gashiyeon*\n\nActually, I need to talk about *Gashiyeon*. Because *Gashiyeon* is the other 50% of why I wanted to make this writeup. And it only took me a couple thousand words to get there.\n\n# Interlude: it's you, the beauty from class 8.\n\n**What is Gashiyeon?**\n\n***Gashiyeon*** is a Yunjae fanfiction, written in Korean by an author known as Maio. Gashiyeon directly translates to \"thorn lily,\" but the fic is better known in English as \"thorn year.\" I'm going to keep calling it Gashiyeon, because that's what I've always known it as.\n\nGashiyeon was published throughout the course of 2006, and consists of three parts. *Reduced Horizons*, the \"prequel,\" *Thorn Lily*, the main story, and *Fox's Cradle*, the \"sequel.\" The three parts all take place 5-10 years from each other, making Gashiyeon a coming of age slash melodrama slash psychological horror. Although I don't think the last one was intentional. That's just how I felt reading it. (I don't read RPF as a general rule, but this fanfic is so far removed from reality reading it felt like I had been transported to an alternate dimension.)\n\n**Why do we care about Gashiyeon?**\n\nBecause Gashiyeon was a smash hit. Gashiyeon became *insanely* popular amongst Korean Cassiopeias. Obviously Gashiyeon was not one of the first Yunjae fanfictions out there, nor was it one of the longest at that point, but it became *the* most well known one. Gashiyeon became well known and adored for three things: because of its writing style, its plot, and its characterization. And it ended up influencing Cassiopeia, Yunjae shippers, and Yunjae themselves in ways that are still visible today.\n\nThe writing style and plot are the two most important factors in why it got popular, so let's get them out of the way first. According to those who have read it in the original Korean, it is written absolutely beautifully. It supposedly has amazing prose, descriptive imagery, and is rife with symbolism and metaphor. I read [translations](https://egashiyeon.livejournal.com/) that were kindly done [by fans](https://honeyiceblend.livejournal.com/2569.html) for free, and so for me to say anything about the prose would be out of line. I have not read it in the original Korean, and so I have not been able to verify if it's true that Gashiyeon is written masterfully. Even if it was though, not even the best written prose would be able to fix the absolute nightmare that is the plot of Gashiyeon.\n\nTo conceptualize the plot of Gashiyeon, think of the most toxic, mid 2000s yaoi manga/anime/story you have ever encountered. If that is not something you have had the misfortune of experiencing, think of Twilight, except written in a way where everyone is significantly more deranged, and with much more awful sex. Now take either or both of those things and combine them with wisdom teeth, incest, eggs, toe sucking, sandwich innuendos, first degree homicide, and second degree homicide, and you'll have a rough idea of what the plot of Gashiyeon is. Except that story would still be better, by virtue of not being Gashiyeon.\n\nI cannot talk more about the plot without going on a multi-thousand word rant, so instead I will leave you with [this tumblr post](https://yoonje.tumblr.com/post/136236173631), and [this review](https://www.asianfanfics.com/blog/view/421847) of Gashiyeon. Anyways, if you read those posts, you'll notice that they describe the characters somewhat. Which brings us to our next point: the characterization.\n\nGashiyeon's characterization, to put it lightly, fucking sucks. Look, there's always going to be issues when you're writing fanfiction about real people. They're real people, first of all, and it's hard to boil down real living breathing people with all their quirks and flaws to the kind of 2D character archetypes fanfiction so often demands. It's even harder to do so while still keeping the characterized version true to the real person's personality. But no part of Gashiyeon's characterization is in any way shape or form based in reality. I used the 2000s yaoi analogy earlier, and if you're familiar with the typical toxic seme/uke dynamic, it's essentially that but on steroids. If you're not, don't worry, because I'm about to explain our characters.\n\nJaejoong, as a real life human, is a complicated man. He [says whatever is on his mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGV0LTX6rk4), he's prone to questionable tattoo choices and impulse decisions, and he recently [named his fans boss babies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHuEBH-lrYg). But he is also an incredibly caring person down to his core, feels incredibly deeply and passionately, and is a talented [singer and songwriter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19xKWEr6EVI). He has been through hell and had an entire industry turn against him, and eventually came out of it ready to heal and move forward. He is also [so good with children](https://twitter.com/i/status/1467212563993690112), its so cute (don't call [him a baby](https://twitter.com/i/status/1393811584707858433) though).\n\n*Gashiyeon* *Jaejoong*, on the other hand, pushes Yunho's mom down a flight of stairs. Later he pushes Yunho's pregnant wife down another flight of stairs. Separate incidents, ten years apart. No regrets, either. He's incredibly self-centered, an overdramatic diva, and a bitch. He successfully convinces Yunho to cheat on his pregnant wife with him, repeatedly. He's petty, demanding, and his love/obsession with Yunho is his defining trait here. He's primarily the way that he is because of manipulation from Yunho, and in turn manipulates him back. He dies at the end, from an ass bleed that makes him so upset \\[cw: &gt;!suicide!&lt;\\] &gt;!it leads to him slitting his wrists and bleeding out in a bathtub!&lt;.\n\nYunho in real life is also a complicated man, by virtue of being a person. He's incredibly dedicated in everything he does, is known amongst people at SM for cornering artists and [giving them advice for hours at a time](https://tvxqexpress.com/2018/11/09/trans-181108-yunhos-advice-time-mentioned-in-happy-together-4-episode-featuring-fellow-sm-artists/) if left unchecked, and is [fiercely competitive and passionate.](https://www.soompi.com/article/1297633wpp/tvxqs-yunho-reveals-actually-thinks-passionate-sm) He's unerringly loyal (sometimes to a fault), struggled immensely during his time as a trainee, and is [known for going out of his way to help others on a regular basis](https://www.asianjunkie.com/2021/02/24/yunhos-schoolmate-talks-about-how-the-tvxq-member-helped-him-after-school-violence-incident/). He's also a big fan of [home shopping channels on TV](https://www.koreaboo.com/stories/tvxqs-yunho-thought-leather-jacket-fire-proof-heechul-set-fire/), so he's kind of an old man on the inside.\n\n*Gashiyeon Yunho* lets his brother get hit by a car because Jaejoong was in love with him instead of Yunho. He's a manipulative bastard, cheats on his pregnant wife and lies to her about it, and has beat the shit out of Jaejoong multiple times. He verbally abuses and gaslights Jaejoong, and in the prequel realizes he has created a monster via his manipulation and abuse and just abandons Jaejoong and leaves him to get kidnapped. Jaejoong killing his mother and wife is not enough to stop him from getting some. He chooses Jaejoong over his own child time and time again. Yunho also dies at the end, from \\[cw: &gt;!suicide!&lt;\\] &gt;!hanging himself on the day of his anniversary with Jaejoong because why the fuck not.!&lt;\n\nTo give Gashiyeon credit, I'm positive it is in no way the first fic to have this type of characterization. But it is by far the one that had the most impact, and also sucks, and I suffered through all of it, so I get to shit on it all I want. This characterization *could* work, if it was executed well, but it's not.\n\nBut yeah, you get the point. The Yunho and Jaejoong of Gashiyeon are so far removed from reality they might as well just be named Joe and Bob for all that it matters. That didn't matter to the readers, though, because they loved it and soon enough the prevailing way people saw Jaejoong and Yunho were \"high-maintenance jealous bottom with no personality other than being obsessed with Yunho\" and \"possessive overbearing top,\" respectively.\n\n**Gashiyeon's impact**\n\nTo put it bluntly, this fic is responsible for one of the worst fandom feedback loops I know of, one which *still* impacts Cassiopeia to this day. Regardless of how or why it happened, Gashiyeon became very, very famous. Famous enough to become as close to \"mandatory reading\" as you can get in a fandom. The majority of Yunjae shippers at the time, especially the Korean ones, read Gashiyeon. And they took the way Gashiyeon characterized Yunho and Jaejoong and made it their bible. This was the lens they were going to view Yunjae through from then on, until the end of time. Of course, this characterization then begins to pop up in other fics. So then even if you haven't read Gashiyeon, you've read these other fics, and so then you start to see them that way. And so on and so forth. This is unfortunate, but at least it's just a fandom thing and doesn't impact the actual people, right?\n\nWrong. Someone at SM must have caught wind of the fact that these traits were what people wanted to see in Yunjae, and as a result, Yunjae began to play into those tropes. Not to an extreme extent by any means, but you'll notice that a lot of the clips people have labeled with [\"jealous jaejoong\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0KhLBmc8x8) or [\"possessive yunho\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwg7vhd3Cn4) happen beginning in late 2006-early 2007. Some of this spike in popularity is because fans were now looking out for anything that matched these behaviors. Though in comparing some of these interactions to earlier ones, you can see Yunjae [playing into the tropes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6jjH_cOLIY) in ways that they hadn't before. It's a mixture of both, with one influencing the other.\n\nOf course, them playing into it only encouraged fans to keep writing and interpreting their behavior like that, and thus those stereotypes of them have prevailed even to this day, where you *still* see people reducing Yunjae to those cores. Jaejoong in particular, because he kind of got the short end of the stick here. And in a lot of other ways, but that's a later thing.\n\nThe idea of the \"high-maintenance bitchy bottom\" would eventually evolve and go on to become a \"trope\" of the designated \"bottom\" of male kpop idol ships---who would constantly get labeled as [jealous](https://lets-talk-baekyeol.tumblr.com/post/77732144799/jealousbaekhyun) and [petty divas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7_OLqQMWxQ). This stereotyping existed in other spheres *long* before this, but it was Gashiyeon that really brought the trope to Kpop and gave it staying power there. Luckily, as far as I can tell, it *seems* to have died down recently. I'm not really involved with recent Kpop groups, or any shipping that takes place there though. Instead I spend my time writing thousands of words on people from the 2000s I don't even ship. Like a well adjusted normal person.\n\nHow big was Gashiyeon really? There were [three editions](https://blog.naver.com/surfacebook/222502736300) of hard copies of Gashiyeon published and distributed---they weren't officially published by a company, but produced by the author. The most damning sign of the influence Gashiyeon had is that Jaejoong himself seemed to know of it. Someone allegedly asked Jaejoong if he had read Gashiyeon, and he responded with \"isn't that one erotic?\" implying that he knew something of Gashiyeon. I, however, cannot confirm this [beyond old screenshots which could very easily be doctored](https://x.com/Sarangjoongie/status/1042838455078678528?s=20). Given that Jaejoong and Yunho would later go on to admit to reading mpreg fic of the two of them, it wouldn't be off brand for him to know of it..\n\nAnd as one more point to illustrate how well known Gashiyeon was, years later veteran Kpop group H.O.T. would guest on SNL Korea and [act out a sketch that is *heavily* implied to be about Gashiyeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc69_5MH0l4). Like, they straight up quote it. This is like if NSYNC went on SNL and did a sketch where they acted out One Direction fanfiction. And also if one of the members of one direction had previously been so distraught about NSYNC breaking up that he posted on Instagram saying he had nothing left to live for. Because that is in fact what [teenage Jaejoong did when H.O.T. disbanded](https://imgur.com/a/wS2ituH), making it extra funny that they're the ones acting out this fanfiction about him.\n\nBut now I'm done talking about Gashiyeon, we have covered the major Yunjae events of 2006, and we are ready to end the year with [TVXQ in fursuits singing about depression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTfuyxgdCW0), as one does. So let's move on to 2007. Because if you thought we were anywhere close to being done with this rollercoaster, you'd be wrong.\n\n# 2007: The Eye of the Yunjae Hurricane.\n\nSo throughout all of this, TVXQ have been promoting in Japan as Tohoshinki, on top of and in between their \\~yearly Korean comebacks. SM sent them over in 2005 with no ability to speak Japanese, zero translators, almost no support, and had them singing in stairwells and in half filled conference rooms. Somehow this worked and paid off, and by 2007 TVXQ was a big fucking deal in Japan. They were topping the charts, something only done once before by a Korean artist in Japan (BoA). Japan is much more profitable to make music in compared to South Korea, because you can do significantly more concerts there. So it's not uncommon these days for Kpop groups to have random Japanese releases to try and cash in on that market. While second gen groups like KARA, SHINee, Big Bang, and SNSD would gain significant popularity in Japan, nobody who has come after TVXQ has ever been able to do so to the extent that they have. It got to the point where many people in the general public were unaware they were a Korean group at all, only knowing them as Tohoshinki.\n\nSM has them spend all of 2007 in Japan, doing concert tours and releasing singles and not seeing their family. This meant a sharp decrease in the amount of Yunjae content coming out from fansites, as the majority of sites did not have the money to drop everything and go to Japan to take photos of TVXQ. Some did (looking at you YJLB), but most didn't, especially because Japanese concerts tend to have much stricter rules about photography than Korean concerts do. TVXQ were still promoting and appearing on TV in Japan, so people were still able to get their Yunjae fix that way. Not a lot occurred in terms of Korean Yunjae drama in 2007 though, which means now is as good of a time as ever to talk about the fansites a bit more.\n\nThis isn't related to Yunjae as much it is just interesting to me, but it does help put the hobby in this drama post. There were a *lot* of fanbooks and published fanfiction for TVXQ. I'm not talking like doujins or zines, I mean big fat chunky hardcover books. You could have [literal shelves](https://blog.naver.com/xkarmr/222946218039) full of TVXQ fanbooks/fanfiction. Some were hardcover copies of fanfictions that had been published online already, like with Gashiyeon. Others were compilations put out by the fansites themselves. For example, every year YJP would put out [an anniversary book](https://search.pstatic.net/common/?src=http%3A%2F%2Fblogfiles.naver.net%2Fdata33%2F2008%2F8%2F13%2F33%2Fdsc01070_feolia.jpg&amp;type=sc960_832) containing fics, [artwork](https://search.pstatic.net/common/?src=http%3A%2F%2Fcafefiles.naver.net%2Fdata36%2F2009%2F2%2F2%2F131%2F%25BB%25E7%25C1%25F8_022_rosa3207.jpg&amp;type=sc960_832), and fantaken photos that were exclusive to the books themselves and not published online. Coming from an era where everything is digital and there's not nearly as many hard copies of fanbooks being made, I just think it's really fucking cool that this was a thing. I found out a lot about Korean Cassie fan culture and what the major influential fanworks and fansites were in Korea at the time through the process of looking up some of these books and then encountering people talk about them on forum posts made back in the day.\n\nAlso, the two biggest Yunjae sites I mentioned earlier, YJP and YJLB, *hated* each other. YJP and YJLB both had hard bans on posting photos from the other fansite on their respective sites. I don't know *for sure* if it went both ways because YJP's site is now defunct, but from what I saw on other sites there was definite bad blood between the two fansites which continued until YJP's demise, making YJLB the winner of that particular fandom war.\n\nAnyways, this has been a fun detour but we should probably check back in with Yunjae. Surely nothing insane has happened while we were gone and--oh. They are now married. Okay.\n\nWell, \"married,\" heavy on the quotes. On June 10^(th) 2007, during an episode of the radio show they hosted in Japan called BIGEASTATION, Yunho and Jaejoong were [asked which member of TVXQ they'd choose to marry if they had to](https://youtu.be/u1l9bQYHUic). Completely unsurprisingly, they chose each other, and joked that they were now a happily married couple. Poor Junsu was also there and just had to bear witness to this happening in front of him. Obviously Yunjae fans went fucking insane at this, and the day became known as their wedding anniversary, and shippers [still celebrate it to this day](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yunjae16thAnniversary?src=hashtag_click). Like, this day is taken incredibly seriously. Much less so now than a decade ago, but the Yunjae anniversary is sacred to Yunjae shippers all the same.\n\nOverall though, 2007 consists mostly of continuation of the theme of [fanservice with hints of \"more,\"](https://favim.com/pd/s2/orig/28/jaejoong-yunho-yunjae-Favim.com-238841.gif) just in Japan instead of Korea this time. The number of Cassieopeia and Yunjae shippers are still continuing to rise, and while 2006 may have been the peak of the Yunjae Yaoi Inferno, 2008 would propel the group itself to new heights.\n\n\\-\n\n2008 and beyond will be covered in [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/16z33jl/kpop_the_divorce_of_the_century_the_rise_and_fall/) of this story, because this monstrosity ended up being so long it wouldn't fit in a single post.

I don't want armies that can magically replenish themselves in a couple of turns I want to worry about harsh terrain. I want vulnerable transports and fleets to defend them. \n\n I want to actually have to worry about the campaign terrain. Instead we have crap like a beastmen and skaven being able to auto-ambush out of thin air. And I've lost track of how many factions have a special movement stance to just avoid terrain entirely.\n\nI want to have complex building chains that interact with each other. It felt so rewarding in Rome 2/Attila to have that one special province in your empire you had worked on for the last 50 turns to specialize. You hand tailored it have the right agriculture, shipyard, military camp, industry, and the right main settlement so that every cavalry unit trained in this province was 10 times the cavalryman of a regular province. You didn't even want to train cavalry anywhere else in the world because cavalry trained anywhere else might as well be riding donkeys compared to the super-horse program you had....in Fantasy I don't get that. I hit tier 5 and just build the unique building and now I just magically have good cavalry being trained. I don't want cookie cutter provinces I want to look at the terrain and the location of the province combined with possible unique buildings to create something special.\n\nI want battles to be decided by things like tactics, positioning, and formations. And I just don't get that in the Fantasy games. The maps are too small to set up an ambush. There's usually only one clump of trees so it's obvious where the \"ambush\" is. It's very difficult to use light cavalry to draw away a significant portion of the enemy army to split them up because there's nowhere to run to due to map size.  Formations matter so little when you can just hurl monsters like wrecking balls and smash straight through. You actually get penalized for formations because of things like wind/vortex spells. Part of me thinks I would prefer it if only legendary Lords had access to the most powerful spells. Just look at YouTube so many of the \"let's plays\" revolve around just using a mage on a mount to nuke the enemy army into oblivion. No tactics at all. It's not even lore friendly because if an average bright wizard in Warhammer summoned a flaming tornado his head would explode from the amount of warp juice he had used\n\nI want to have to worry about Lords and heroes dying. Yes it's an absolutely horrible feeling when a high-level person dies but there needs to be some sort of risk. Otherwise again the game just gets reduced to gamey mechanics. Throw your character  forward to attract the enemy attention and then nuke them with magic who cares if the Lord dies too he'll be back in a few turns.\n\nI want family trees and internal politics. Nation stability should be more than just public order. \n\nI want an economy that you have to build and take care of. I don't want every nation to have an economic gimmick that gives them a ridiculous economy. It's ok for Economy to be weaker and harder. \n\nMaybe I'm in the minority but I feel like CA is making historical and fantasy players drift apart because each game is more and more simplified. The game is no longer a strategic puzzle to solve with the resources and mechanics given to me. It's about laughing maniacally and sweeping the puny enemies aside with overpowered mechanics.\n\nEdit: since it was unclear I actually love the fantasy games. But I think they're a different kind of fun than historical and Troy shows that CA didn't understand that. \n\nFantasy games have way more of a power trip. It's about the cool factor of a well timed spell, the laughing maniacally at your never ending hordes, and the smashing through your enemies with monsters.\n\nHistorical games are different there isn't as much instant gratification but there's much more of a slow buildup and satisfaction to a well run empire. Historical battles are just as fun but it's about positioning and tactics more than timing and heroics. \n\nBoth are fun. But they're different kinds of fun which is why Troy failed by trying to take the middle ground and I'm concerned that CA hasn't learned this lesson.","subreddit":"totalwar","comments":335,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/16oh8yz/what_makes_a_historical_total_war_game/"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-14","timestamp":1694651703,"title":"Why do we all like trains.","text":"I used to be offended by the stereotype that we all like trains (I think it feeds into the whole 'autistic male brain' thing) until I attended ASAN's autism campus inclusion thing a few years ago.

That things were always like this, and that Americans have the \"God given right\" of the American dream.\n\nHowever, this reality of a exceptionally wealthy and prosperous middle class by global standards is NOT the norm or the natural way of things, but a by product of a very unique and relatively recent set of historical circumstances, specifically, the end of World War II. At the end of the second world war, the US was the only major industrial power left with its industry and infrastructure unscathed. This gave the US a dramatic economic advantage over the rest of the world, as all other nations had to buy pretty much everything they needed from the US, and use their cheap natural resources as a form of payment.\n\nAfter the end of world War II, pretty anywhere in the world, if you needed tools, machines, vehicles, capital goods, aircraft, etc...you had little choice but to \"buy American\". So money flowed from all over the world into American businesses.\n\nBut the the owners of those businesses had to negotiate labor deals with the American relatively small and highly skilled workforce. And since the owners of capital had no one else they could hire to men the factories, many concessions had to be given to the labor unions. This allowed for the phenomenal growth and prosperity of the US middle class we saw in the 50s and 60s: White picket fence houses in the suburbs, with 2 large family cars parked in front was the norm for anyone who worked hard in the many factories and businesses that dotted the American landscape back then.\n\nHowever, over time, the other industrial powers rebuild themselves and started to compete with the US. German and Japanese cars, Belgian and British steel, Dutch electronics and French tools started to enter the world market and compete with American companies for market share. Not only that, but countries like Brazil, South Africa, India, China, Mexico, Thailand, Turkey, South Korea and more also became industrialized. This meant that they were no longer selling their natural resources cheaply in exchange for US made industrial goods. Quite the contrary, they themselves started to bid against the US for natural resources to fuel their own industries. And more importantly, the US work force no longer was the only one qualified to work on modern factories and to have proficiency over modern industrial processes. An Australian airline needs a new commercial jet? [Brazil's EMBRAER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-3m__yRBkg) and European Airbus can offer you products as good as anything made in the US. Need power tools or a pickup truck? You can buy American, but you can also buy South Korean, Indian or Turkish.\n\nThis meant that the US middle class could no longer easily outbid pretty much everyone else for natural resources, and the owners of the capital and means of production no longer were \"held hostage\" by this small and highly skilled workforce. Many other countries now had an industrial base that rivals or surpasses that of the US. And they had their own middle classes that are bidding against the US middle class for those limited natural resources. And manufacturers now could engage in global wage arbitrage, by moving production to a country with cheaper labor, which killed all the bargaining power of the unions.\n\nIf everyone in the world lived and consumed like what the average American sees as a reasonable middle class lifestyle (i.e. drive an F-150 or an SUV, families with multiple cars, living in a house in the suburbs, high meat consumption, etc...), [it would take 4.1 Earths to provide enough resources to sustain that lifestyle](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33133712). But we don't have 4.1 Earths, we have just one. And unlike before, the USA no longer can outbid the rest of the world for those limited resources.\n\nGRAPH: [The U.S. Share of the Global Economy Over Time](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/u-s-share-of-global-economy-over-time/)\n\nThat is where the decline of the US middle class is coming from. There are no political solutions for it, as no one, not even Trump's protectionism or the Democrat's Unions, can put the globalization genie back into a bottle. It is the way it is. Any politician who claims to be able to restore \"the good old days\" is lying. So yes, the old middle class lifestyle of big house, big car, all you can eat buffet, shop until you drop while golfing on green grass fields located in the middle of the desert is not coming back no matter what your politician on either side of the isle promised you.\n\nWe are going back to the normal, where the US middle class is not that different from the middle classes from the rest of the world. Like a return to what middle class expectations are elsewhere, including the likes of Europe, Japan, South Korea and Malaysia. Their cars are smaller. They don't change cars as often. The whole family might share a single car. Some families don't even own a car and rely on public transportation instead. Their homes are smaller. They don't eat as much meat and their food portions are smaller.\n\nThey are not starving. They are not living like peasants. But their standard of living is lower than what we in the US have considered a \"middle class\" lifestyle since the end of World War II.\n\n**Now, that is not to say that there isn't a lot of inequality in the US or to deny that policies are needed to address that inequality**. But my issue with most of the \"give us equality\" folks in the US is that they imagine the rich being taxed so that they can finally afford that house in the burbs and the F-150 in the driveway like their parents were able to. That is NOT going to happen for the reasons I've already explained. No amount of taxation and public policy will make that happen. That version of the middle class is never coming back. Where I see public policy for wealth redistribution having an active and effective role is making healthcare more affordable, making the cities more walkable and livable so that young Americans can transition from the suburbs to smaller and more affordable homes in dense urban neighborhoods where cars are not a basic necessity to earn income. Our middle class will become more like other countries' middle classes. That cannot be changed. What we can aim for is having our social services and social safety nets more in line to what exits and is available for the middle classes of those other countries.","subreddit":"economy","comments":190,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/172kyqh/the_prosperous_and_wealthy_american_middle_class/"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-22","timestamp":1695369240,"title":"So when did it become \"not okay\" to talk about how narcissistic people effected you?","text":"I understand how the term became oversaturated and over used in psychology circles but it's still a helpful term for people like me. \n\nWhy am I being told that I am \"stigmatizing\" npd when people with this disorder blatantly harm people?? People say that abuse and narcissism arent the same, and I agree.\n\nThat's what set apart my father's behavior from other \"abusers\". My dad NEVER put his hands on me. But he did brag about playing mind games with people. My dad wasn't your classic \"abuser\". \n\nHe seemed nice on the surface but behind closed doors he was a huge jerk. He put a lot of time and money into curating this image perfect father image to the public, while at home I was being neglected. \n\nDidn't have food, didn't have clean clothes, but my dad would showboat in front others buying me toys and gifts that I didn't need. He ALWAYS used money to win my good favor. He would yell and make me cry, then make it up with money.\n\nAnytime he got called out by anyone, he would act calm and collected to that person's face then go behind their backs and play victim to everyone they know around them.  That is why my sister had a strained relationship with my mother. He caused that. My mom didn't fit the mold her wanted her too, so he tried to destroy her. \n\nEspecially when she worked up the courage to leave. He tried taking her car during their divorce knowing that that was the only form of transportation we had. So that meant he did not care if his kids were stuck walking to school in the winter. Even though my mom was able to keep the car, this ended up happening anyway because her car broke down and guess who didnt help us? \n\nI'm honestly furious about this sudden \"omg narcs don't deserve all this hatred\" trend. What about the damage these people cause?? It feels like a massive slap in the face that I'm being painted as some mean person because I'm talking about how narcissistic people effect my life. \n\nThe word maybe overused to others but it took learning what this label was to FINALLY understand what was wrong with my dad and why I always felt like I was going crazy around him.","subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","comments":155,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/16p496t/so_when_did_it_become_not_okay_to_talk_about_how/"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-05","timestamp":1696503850,"title":"Anyone else really just not able to stand men at this point?","text":"Please don\u0019t take this as discrimination! \n\nI was on the train the other day minding my own business when a man asked if he could sit in the seat next to me.

Is it LA or is it me?","text":"I moved from the Bay Area to the westside in 2021. I always enjoyed my visits to LA and came here with hope that it would be a fun and fulfilling new chapter in my life. It's been two years and I can't f\\*\\*\\*ing stand it.\n\nWhat torments me is that I can't figure out whether the core problem is LA or me. Is this place objectively worse than the average metropolitan city? Or would I actually find community and fulfillment here if I only I could change my attitude?\n\nI get it - \"wherever you go, there you are.\" I've struggled with depression for years and I know that colors my perception of the world. But what started as sporadic down periods pre-LA has turned into full-blown clinical depression here. I'm prescribed anti-depressants and they help a little but feel like a band-aid over a wound that won't heal.\n\nI've thought about it (a \\*lot\\*) and there's three things that bother me most:\n\n1. TRANSPORTATION. The sprawl of LA combined with the abysmal public transport system adds a ton of friction to communities forming and staying together. The vast majority of people simply won't endure 30+ minutes of traffic each way for casual group hangs, or to foster a new friendship. And unless they live in your neighborhood or a bordering one, \\*everywhere\\* takes 30+ minutes to drive to. The end result is a series of weirdly isolated bubbles instead of anything close to a unified city.\n2. ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. This city attracts people with a lot of ambition. A significant percentage came here for one of two reasons: 1) To get famous, or 2) To get rich. (Have you ever heard anyone say \"I moved to LA for the culture\"??) To achieve such goals, you need to be a workaholic. What is workaholism but an addiction? And what is an addiction but an escape from pain? So you have an industry led by people with unprocessed pain all enabling each other and obsessing over status, and since they produce the entertainment that defines a major part of western culture, they're treated like gods. Their value system (AKA external success = self-worth) trickles down to the rest of LA and poisons the groundwater.\n3. PARKS. Sometimes all I want is a peaceful spot away from the rush of traffic and screams of children/homeless people. I've been hard pressed to find that in LA. I lived in Melbourne Australia for a while and that city is littered with beautiful parks. NYC has Central Park and a bunch of unique green spaces. San Francisco is the size of DTLA and has Golden Gate Park, Dolores Park, the Presidio and more. On the westside, the five biggest green spots on the map are four country clubs and a cemetery.\n\nAnd then on the flipside, you have the answer you get 9 out of 10 times when you ask someone if they like living in LA: **\"*****\\*hesitates\\**** **The weather is nice.\"**\n\nAm I seeing this wrong? Am I the a-hole?
