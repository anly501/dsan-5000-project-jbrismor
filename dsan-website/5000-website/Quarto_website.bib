	abstract = {The form of a city has a major impact on the lifestyles of its residents. As urban centers grow, careful strategies are required to ensure that the regional quality of life is not adversely affected by this growth. An important strategic consideration is transportation planning. Questions regarding the sustainability of dispersed car dependent urban forms have led to a renewed interest in public transportation. This paper examines access to public transportation and discusses approaches for improving such access. Examples from the South East Queensland region of Australia will be used for illustration.},
