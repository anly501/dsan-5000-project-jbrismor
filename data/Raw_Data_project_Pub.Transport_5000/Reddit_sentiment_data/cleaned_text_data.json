        "cleaned_text": "Firstly let me preface this by saying I adore Vietnam the culture the strong will and tenacity of the people in the face of adversity the dynamism the air of progress and the fascinating history museums and sites That said I have one major point of complaint the state of infrastructure in particular transport infrastructure in the country is totally unacceptable Now I know Vietnam is still a relatively poor country and is still significantly behind the likes of Thailand or Malaysia in economic development although it is progressing rapidly But even for a country at its income level real per capita GDP of k it s still not good enough And fixing it will be crucial if Vietnam is to have sustainable long run economic success and capitalise on current investment inflows Intra city Public transport this is the biggest sticker for me There is no semblance of public transport in Vietnamese cities HCMC Saigon with a metro area of M people has no metro system That is absolutely insane For comparison this https moovitapp com index public transit maps map Thailand Bangkok Bangkok Rail Transit Network pdf is Bangkok s with a metro area of M This https moovitapp com index public transit maps map Brazil Sao Paulo e Regio Metropolitan Transport Map pdf is S o Paulo s with a metro area of about M Both are rapidly expanding too as you can see here https youtu be i sFfqq N Q feature shared and here https youtu be yuRKkbeo g feature shared Notice that even when these cities were significantly poorer in the s and s they still had a semblance of a transit system HCMC yet has nothing Hanoi isn t much better Metro area population of M yet only one line This https myrapid com my bus train rapid kl rapid kl integrated transit map is that of Kuala Lumpur a metro area of similar population Now of course these cities are significantly richer than Hanoi or HCMC but they started building out these systems when they were poorer Building huge mass transit systems takes time and it needs to be started urgently in Vietnamese cities Intracity Bus services in Vietnam are also totally unreliable or non existent in many cases The issue of intracity transport is a ticking time bomb in Vietnam Because as people get richer and move from bikes to cars the cities will become more gridlocked Walking around Hanoi Da Nang or Saigon you can t help but ask yourself if all these people on bikes were in cars it would be physically impossible to get anywhere The city would literally choke and shut down The lack of public transit also makes roads more dangerous as bad riders and drivers are forced to use motor vehicles for lack of other options Inter city public transport Rail The intercity rail in Vietnam is so ancient and inadequate it s comedic at this point The trains are decades old and the technology is literally Victorian Vietnam is the perfect place for high speed rail I m shocked a country long high speed rail corridor from Hanoi to HCMC hasn t begun construction yet But things like regional and commuter rail are also important I was on a train in the north of Vietnam and I think our average speed across the journey was about kmph That is disastrous It means the only way to actually travel between larger cities is by air which is hugely inefficient slow door to door as airports take hours to traverse and often involves a connection in Hanoi or HCMC For smaller cities near each other where the train is the only option there is really are no good transportation options Road sure but what about buses Vietnamese intercity buses have improved a lot over the years but the fact is the state of road infrastructure is still poor There just aren t enough highways For such a dense country I would expect at least one highly modern fast wide highway between Hanoi and Can Tho passing outside all the major cities but there just isn t a pan Vietnamese high speed road And the road infrastructure within cities is totally inadequate it often taking upwards of an hour to get out of the city centre The poor roads are not only slow but they re dangerous and make logistics expensive Again I know Vietnam is still developing but what concerns me is that these projects are barely even under construction let alone real progress being made with them Transport infrastructure is one of the most important areas to invest for long run economic growth I know the reasons it s not happening phenomenally high levels of political corruption messed up political incentives and wrong priorities But I was surprised that during my time in Vietnam people didn t seem to notice that the transport infrastructure is woefully inadequate and is going to create an increasing suffocation on growth as time goes on Something desperately needs to be done about it as the issue is only going to become more problematic as time goes on Vietnam is incredibly lucky with its human geography The cities are effectively all in a curved line along the coast meaning only a few modern high quality transit and road corridors could connect up the vast majority of the population The larger cities are also built on relatively flat deltas and plains This makes construction easier and Vietnam needs to capitalise on this and invest in its transport if it is to succeed Edit I can t believe I forgot to mention this but air pollution is the other huge issue caused by lack of public transport and slow traffic Vietnamese cities are very air polluted and this can cause respiratory diseases cancer and death for many people especially the already vulnerable"

        "cleaned_text": "I m a current employee at SAE not for much longer I am writing this whole thing because SAE is a popular choice for low time pilots and I wish I had a lot of this knowledge before I applied I have a lot of things I d like to share if you re considering working here I can only speak toward the Caravan side of the operation A lot of these thoughts have been bottled up for the better part of a year and a half so bear with me I ve also been somewhat interviewing other pilots to get their thoughts as well which will be included TLDR below each major category and at the very end So here we go starting with a pros cons list Pros very valuable time building professional experience in different airports weather conditions in a low risk aircraft will look good on a resume and easy to do well with interviews as far as explaining your systems operations in an interview down the road Cons the company lies to you tries to get you to sign do things you maybe shouldn t very low FO pay is run by dirtbags for the most part the list could go on really but those are the main things Overview SAE is a operation funded by E ssential A ir S ervice EAS routes ran by the government We do short hops from small towns connecting them to large airports It s a popular job for low time pilots the company says they hire at hours total time minimum but this isn t entirely true as I know many pilots who got hired at The strategy here is to get in get your time and get out without anyone knowing you were even there I cannot emphasize this enough If the people upstairs know your name as a pilot on the line that s a bad thing and I m told this is generally true of any airline Logging time Wasn t sure where else to put this really There s this thing called the Pilot Development Program where you have to get each flight signed by a qualified PIC for it to count towards your time Our Ops Spec was changed some time ago we used to allow flights to operate without an SIC as long as a functional autopilot was installed During this era we had the PDP This was changed and FOs are now required crew As far as logging time goes I m someone that uses an electronic logbook and I put their signature in myself along with their contact information and a note saying that we followed the regs of the PDP this was good enough Traditionally companies using PDP have to have the SIC logbook signed by a qualified PIC for each flight The thing is that while the Caravan is techinically a single pilot aircraft our company is required to have a PIC and SIC Therefore the specifics of getting your PIC to sign your logbook every time don t apply at SAE Since we have to have both the PDP doesn t apply At the very least I put their name in my logbook and it has contact information The company will tell you that we technically use the PDP but again since our company is required to have PIC and SIC aboard the PIC signatures are not required every time as outlined by the fed The Good Time value I d like to start with the positives since at the end of the day I do believe this is a company worth working for First and foremost the time is definitely worth it Turbine time is no joke especially in the event that jet companies get choosy between you and the guy with hours of piston time After captain you re looking at PIC turbine time also very valuable not just for the time aspect but showing experience as PIC in a airline The next job knows you take passengers at most They know you re doing short hops they know all about how the company is run what you fly etc but it s about more than that There is a lot of experience to be gained working here Some of the big jet guys might scoff but this job allows you to get in the habit of making professional good choices on the ground and in the air in a plane that can t really get away from you if you get too stressed The Caravan babies you really It can be a great entry into the industry because the mistakes you will make hopefully won t be mistakes that could cost your license or lives SkyWest There is an opportunity to get a guaranteed interview with SkyWest They do their little presentation at indoc pass out some pens and ask you to sign a contract It states that you will commit to flying with SAE as an FO upgrade to captain and fly hours as PIC before you leave the company for SkyWest Your choices are to either do this or not go to SkyWest and agree to do hours PIC with SAE Contract also comes with split up in to three stages released to the line at SAE captain at SAE and completion of SkyWest ground school I wanted to go to SkyWest next so this was a no brainer for me If you leave early or choose to not go to SkyWest they will ask for their money back but you can set up a payment plan with them SkyWest owns a portion of SAE and has a vested interest in hiring from SAE I know a lot of people saying that it would be stupid to sign the contract that SkyWest would just take their money back and not hire you this is idiotic and would defeat the purpose of spending all that money in the first place Airlines make so much money partially because they have pilots News flash you need pilots to have an airline Here s another news flash SkyWest needs more pilots everyone needs more pilots k laughable for SkyWest because they ll make so much more of that back if they hire you Basic economics Good times I have had really tough times here and really great times here The flying can be a lot of fun There s a lot of opportunity to refine your skills in a plane that will truly babysit you There are some really good people that work for this company Hard working ground crew some people in upper management that truly want you to be safe and succeed These things go a long way for me at least TLDR SAE offers some serious value in time with logging turbine hours and airline experience PIC turbine can go a long way Future employment opportunities offered by SkyWest with k bonus There s a lot of good times to be had here in general with good people and some awesome views from the Caravan It s hard work but it s engaging and challenging in its own way The Bad Indoc Now the bad and there s plenty of it When you interview you re going to be told you can easily expect hours a month this is a lie Really no one can tell you how many hours you will get per month You might get one month another month I knew FOs scheduled for hours but had so many flights cancelled that they ended up only logging hours At indoc you will be told to sign a promissory note fancy word for a contract that says if you leave early get fired you will be sued You will be told to sign on the spot or walk out the door It s a simple one page contract I read it thoroughly and signed I desperately needed the job as many of my colleagues did SAE has been suing former pilots and I for one can understand why many of them left more on that in a bit I understood what I signed Many of my colleagues did not and they signed because there was some rumor that SAE isn t suing anyone Now they re running around upset because their going to court since they broke the contract This was their foolish mistake I d rather sign a bad contract on purpose than based on wishful thinking As valid as some of their complaints may be don t be like them At indoc you ll meet the heads of several departments The Director of HR will talk to you about how you re a child and irresponsible and give you the usual HR seminar while using basically any opportunity she can to belittle you so just don t ask questions The Director of Maintenance will literally yell at you and tell you that you don t know anything about flying He ll use his hour to expand on how much of an idiot you are despite knowing nothing about you and despite not having flown himself in decades if at all I think if it were up to him the mechanics would be the only pilots The CEO will come in and give his speech about how awesome he is and how SAE is the greatest small airline to exist despite secretly not so secretly being a downright scumbag who likes to fire pilots who refuse to fly in unsafe conditions The Director of Ops will come in and speak as well from my experience he s actually a really nice guy but I try to interact with these people as little as possible overall Equipment At indoc you may also be told that the majority of the fleet is comprised of G EX Caravans This is also a lie Most of our aircraft are from the s early s Most of the FO instruments do not work Maintenance tries their best but they re encouraged by the Director of Maintenance to cut corners and all the good mechanics the ones who really care and are really knowledgeable leave as soon as they can The company is supposed to have autopilots it s listed as required equipment but pilots write it up because they re from and don t work So the SAE solution is to just remove the autopilot altogether and claim it s temporarily deactivated when we all know it s permanent Hours amp Pay Many in my class were told we would get a certain amount of hours a month some of us went as far to get a letter from our boss confirming that showed that to our landlords creditors etc and got the apartment car etc only to have the hours slashed in half or even to a quarter out of nowhere As an FO it is a struggle to live That s just the truth You are told you re a required crewmember the CEO will brag about all the efforts he went through to get the FAA to see it that way but no one will care about your ideas or how you re going to afford your next meal As a captain life is easy You get bonus pay on top of bonus pay they beg you to fly and you can ask for an extra on your day off flying and they ll happily say yes For FO s on their day off your pay is and if you beg they ll come up from that to a whopping Never mind that the plane doesn t leave without you on board anyway but they re counting on someone else showing up if you don t want to and someone will Some captains have asked why this is the case to trusted people in upper management and they say they re fighting for better FO pay but there s a lot of pushback from everyone else I m guessing from the Director of Maintenance HR CEO President of Something etc just based on their attitude towards pilots Basically your average captain will easily make four times as much as your average FO The pay structure goes like this under hours hour in training when released to the line At hours hour At hours hour captain is hour direct entry is something like hour with bonuses if you sign a longer contract If a captain hits hours in a month all hours after that are paid at time and a half If a captain flies hours in a month they ll get a bonus check of When I was an FO some months I got hours other months I hovered around hours for a while As a captain I m almost guaranteed to get hours even if I m scheduled for less there is so much bonus flying available and they ll pay so much extra that it doesn t matter All pilots are guaranteed hours a month in pay Bases You also may be told in indoc that you will have your first choice of base I ve asked many folks in the class before me and classes after they all said this is still being said It s not true They don t care about your choice of where you want to go they will throw your name in one bowl and the list of bases in another bowl and pick at random You can transfer but it s not guaranteed If you re commuting tough If you re moving in base tough Got a family not their problem Can t afford to move commute for reasons not their problem Chief Pilot I haven t had much experience with our Chief Pilot but your interaction with him and anyone else in upper management should be as minimal as possible With the CP it depends on which side of the bed he woke up on that day Might be in a great mood might rip your head off As a captain I ve personally had no issues when it came to me not wanting to fly due to safety concerns but I have friends who had the exact opposite experience Since the investigation by the FAA became more widely known mentioned below I think this portion of the toxic culture has shifted a bit towards the better but it s still not where it should be TLDR if you re told something is guranteed they re lying to you There s an overall negative and quite unhelpful culture at SAE Aircraft are very old and maintained only well enough to be mostly airworthy FO pay is absolutely abysmal but if you re financially responsible you will stay afloat probably Captain pay is massively better The Ugly The Fed This company is currently under some form of investigation by the FAA For what specifically I don t know But it most definitely has to do with unsafe practices such as upper management pressuring pilots to fly in unsafe conditions though that seems to have gotten better recently We know for a fact that the FAA has dropped the hammer on SAE and some employees at Southern have been forced out as a result There s no communication in this company which leads to much frustration between the pilots and ground crew I ve been scheduled to fly when I m not legally able to been activated on reserve with no notice I had a friend who was scheduled to fly in a different state on his day off with zero notice or transportation just to wake up to an angry phone call from management The Money The Company went public on the NYSE a few months ago and the stock price tanked immediately It s been hovering a little above a dollar per share I m not a stonks guy but this is a decent indication of where the company is at financially The company s business model is based on EAS routes provided by the fed SAE receives hundreds of thousands of dollars per week flying in to places like ATL LAX ORD DFW all that money seems to go absolutely everywhere else except where it is most needed and it s needed to be spent on the people and the aircraft for once The company has also expanded way too much and despite the CEO saying he s done expanding there s rumors we re going to expand anyway He s warned by his management team that it s not a wise decision and does it anyway The problem is we don t have the staff or aircraft for the bases we have now leading to angry city council meetings and threats of revoking the contract with SAE A while ago a new top tier scheduling system was proposed because ours is garbage too much money Upgrading aircraft so we don t have failing instruments every week too much money Paying the pilots and ground crew a respectable wage too much money Rotating the aircraft to Maintenance bases so that they get the attention they need too much money Salary increases for the top people Fantastic idea Placing an order for a bunch of electric Caravans that no one knows if they actually work Fantastic idea These frustrations are just some of the reasons why pilots leave early and end up getting sued by the company like I mentioned earlier If you leave early as an FO you ll be sued for something like k If you leave early as a captain you ll be sued for around k The claim is that these are proportional to the cost it was to train you which I doubt The Training The training that SAE provides is kind of a joke Ground school is in depth Sim training and flight training is rushed You re so close to being on the line that they definitely cut corners to get you released to the line and it shows in the quality of flying I ve personally seen from many of our pilots I sometimes wonder how some of these people got their license to begin with I ve had captains that couldn t track a localizer or a glideslope had an FO that couldn t hold a heading or altitude to save his life the list could go on While you can t or rather shouldn t have to teach these things to pilots you can at least take more time to really show you care and work with them this culture does not exist in the training department Some of the instructors are very impatient As an FO I went into training being told over and over again that it was four days of flight training My instructor wanted to give me my checkride on day two and not because I showed skill I was obviously not ready but he had lots more waiting in line for training and needed to get me out of the way These kinds of practices lead to unsafe practices on the line Captain upgrade training is joining a zoom call instructor puts on a video for you to watch and leaves You ll have some opportunity to ask questions to which the Chief Pilot will just get mad at you for not looking it up yourself Then you re sent to your checkride and IOE I feel like I have to say it again this is your c aptain upgrade training The company may send you to Flight Safety for your training after indoc This is a far superior kind of training than what SAE offers There doesn t seem to be any rhyme or reason to who gets to go Interestingly in the contract with SAE I mentioned earlier you owe about k to the company if you leave get fired It costs around k to send someone to Flight Safety but doesn t cost nearly as much to send them to the SAE training in Hawaii or DuBois The Captains Speaking of which let s talk about the captains of SAE They re awful except for me of course I m amazing as I m sure everyone I ve ever met would agree In all seriousness there are so many different standards at this company When I was an FO this was extremely frustrating It was like every other captain I flew with had it right and everyone else has it all wrong they know the airplane like the back of their hand they know better procedures than outlined in the manual they know more than the Check Airmen the list goes on I was given so many different preflight briefings as an FO it was hard to keep the facts straight Everyone had a different idea of what they would do in an emergency at what altitude they would turn back for the runway if need be It was like the basic information was just not agreed upon by the common captain It was a major relief to upgrade for this reason alone because I knew I would work with my FO and that we would only rely on the facts in the cockpit and not some completely made up procedure However I also had some real cream of the crop captains who taught me so much about how to be a better pilot Were it not for them I would seriously be lost and in a world of trouble There are some captains at this company that really empathize with your struggles as an FO and will guide you on the best practices of the aircraft and how to handle working for a company like this I ll be forever grateful for these people and absolutely none of them were direct entry captains The direct entry captains are awful every single one of them As an FO I probably flew with or direct entry captains and they were some of the worst pilots I ve ever flown with by far The fact that they entered in as a captain I think made it so much worse Had these kinds of captains talking to me like I was one of their students meanwhile I had four times the amount of hours that they did in the aircraft Never met one direct entry captain that was truly willing to work with their FO and it seriously hurt the operation There s not a single direct entry captain I would trust in any emergency situation TLDR FAA is investigating SAE company may be on the verge of financial collapse but I don t think that s likely to happen anytime soon because of how much money we make from the fed but they spend money on all the wrong things the ground training is good but the sim flight training can be very bad and very rushed depending on who you get The captains can be downright awful or some of the best people you ll ever fly with it s a roll of the dice The Maintenance I wanted to expand on this point I ve mentioned a few times that the airplanes are in awful condition I once met a mechanic at a base once hired outside of SAE to do some work on our plane We did a walk around and he proceeded to point out all the ways in which the plane was not even airworthy This mechanic had worked on Caravans for a decade and had never seen so many issues It was obvious to him that some of the SAE mechanics had been cutting corners or flat out releasing airplanes ot the line that were not airworthy This goes to a larger point I would like to make about the Director of Maintenance He is someone you never want to interact with Some mechanics at SAE like many people are just trying to do a good job When you have a boss like that who controls your life who you depend on for reliable information it can be tough to make the right call That being said I have only met one mechanic who has a true vested interest in doing his best and only releasing safe airplanes to the line We had a phenominal mechanic who came from a company that SAE absorbed and he left shortly after He saw the signs and moved on Others don t have that ability right now I can confirm that mechanics at Southern are passively or actively encouraged to cut corners This was a truly scary thing to discover because flying an airplane that is not airworthy to be discovered by the Fed is a bad place to be in as a pilot Or worse perishing because of it The Bottom Line Perspective Flying for SAE will be entirely what you make of it Are you going to be just a spiteful individual embarrassed to fly the Caravan frustrated with the company all day long hating passengers hating handflying hating the pay just hating everything Or are you going to go a different route As you can tell I ve got a lot of feelings about the company many of us do but I honestly wouldn t go back I was in absolute poverty when I got offered this job it was a feeling of relief that I kept reminding myself of to keep pushing forward even if the company still kept me in poverty as an FO I had a job I had a foot in the door Now the door has fully opened I m out of the company pretty soon I ve wanted to say something about my experience for a while but I wanted to make sure I experienced everything the good the bad and the ugly before I really formed an opinion I felt was worth sharing I ve seen quite a few pilots on reddit trash SAE read one comment mocking the it s valuable time message that I m basically saying here well it is and I believe that s a fact Earlier I mentioned it being between you and a guy with hours of piston this was one of my good friends who came from SAE they flat out told him the turbine time was the deciding factor there and hired him practically on the spot People will claim you ll make much more doing this or that that s just not the case for myself and many others I know How much you ll make being a CFI for example largely has to do with the economy and your area how much you re willing to put yourself out there how many students you have If it works for you that s awesome but it wasn t going to work for me I sent out job applications when I got to hours badgered all of them SAE was the only one who got back to me The job market may have changed but back when I applied your choices were basically CFI pipeline inspection or SAE I ve had A A pilots and so on tell me about how they think it s really cool to fly a Caravan it s a different kind of flying than what they get to do they miss how involved flying used to be and so on I don t say that to sound like they envy pilots like me although one did jokingly say that I ve read similar comments on youtube videos on bush flying and the like I say this to make the point that there is value in all different kinds of flying and there is trumendous value in flying the Caravan for SAE it is just going to come with an equally hefty amount of BS I did find that once I upgraded a lot of that BS went away or I was respected enough to be able to deal with it properly to make a proper living to be safe When you re a very low time pilot looking for your first job the pay can t be everything What else are you gaining from this job What about the experience Professionalism Perfection opportunities Challenges Questions worth asking yourself both when you re looking towards a job and when you re looking back on one from the other side There were days I woke up wondering why I m putting myself through this Waking up two hours early to get ready and make my lunch eventually started skipping lunch because it was costing too much in groceries getting to work an hour before departure loading up annoying people sometimes flying with someone I really didn t like or trust at all then I put on my s music watch the sunrise and it all becomes clear or at least clear enough to do it over and over again I have had to make a lot of personal sacrifices to get where I am today as many of us in the industry have Many of us have had to say goodbye to long time friends goodbye to home it s tough and definitely took a toll on me with the struggles of this job The toughest part was believing I was finally out of poverty when I got that job offer I had done it I succeeded and it was all uphill from here That s wishful thinking life is never like that I still had to struggle but if I knew half the things I ve outlined here it would ve been a lot easier to get through those tough times I think if the company had just been honest with me or if someone had put out information like this I would have been much better prepared That s what I hope I was able to do for someone else with this post I know I can look back on my work with SAE as an overall positive very rewarding experience where I learned a lot became a better pilot became a better individual and took lessons learned from this stepping stone to be applied for the rest of my career At the end of the day I m pretty happy with that Thank you for reading I m happy to answer any questions I can Very much needed TLDR Southern has a lot of issues primarily involving safety qualilty of aircraft quality of training there are a lot of things to consider if you re thinking about working for this company I will walk away with some great experience and also some awful times I know plenty who are walking away with a lawsuit notes on their PRIA wasted time nothing but bad times if you ask them Some things in life are what you make of it I think I was fortunate enough to have enough lemons to make lemonade at SAE but there were many who couldn t get past the massive issues I don t see anything improving unless there s a restructuring of leadership mainly a new CEO to lead the company in a new direction There may be more options for low time pilots now which will give turbine time if that s a goal for you I don t know If I could do it all over again I might try harder for a FedEx feeder but SAE got me where I needed to go For me this was my best option at the time and it worked out just fine If I had no other options and wanted the turbine time I would still go to Southern but would try to enter at hours for the hour It made a big difference Edits Added a section about maintenance expanded on the training added a TLDR"

other disabilities would be left in the dust and couldn t access such a place This argument is flawed for several reasons and as someone who lives with people with limited mobility my mother and my grandma the What about disabled people argument is flawed For context my mother had her knee surgery and for a few weeks she couldn t walk too far as her knee was stiff and couldn t bend too far This is normal don t worry she s fine now Needless to say we had quite the experience and we were lucky enough that my aunt let us borrow her wheelchair which we still have as despite my mom s limited mobility temporary as it is we were able to see places and experience stuff that we have never done before as we were privileged enough to be residing with my grandma who lives in one of the few places in North America that has good accessible transit and overall better urban planning The Lower Mainland of British Columbia Canada As to not plagiarize what this fellow Reddit poster has coined as the Car Savior Complex https www reddit com r fuckcars comments f hw ive seen this a lot online lately this notion I am going to go through some of the characteristics of their definition and how they correlate with my mother s real life experience with limited mobility Going through their Characteristics list point states that Limited Accessibility Consideration Ignoring the accessibility barriers faced by individuals who may find it challenging to enter exit or operate traditional vehicles due to their disability This point was so true in the case of my mother s knee surgery because after she was discharged from the hospital my father and I had so much difficulty trying to get her into our minivan Honda Odyssey Despite minivans generally being better than most cars when it comes to accessibility my mom couldn t bend her knee too far which is needed when it comes to entering a car And sure minivans can be modified to be accessible but those conversions are expensive and are an admittance that standard cars are not accessible What these car brained people fail to acknowledge is that cars are not easy to climb into I remember one time when visiting the US with my father we were at a gas station and we saw this older man struggling to climb out of his oversized pickup truck When he finally got out he saw me sitting in the passenger seat of our minivan and said that and I m transcribing what he said If I knew I would have this mobility issues I wouldn t have driven this pickup truck So yeah he admitted that his pickup truck is difficult to climb into Maybe you shouldn t have bought it in the first place buddy I still have trouble comprehending seeing giant pickup trucks with their handicap passes when I an able bodied person have trouble climbing into a stock modern F Cars are not accessible and pickup trucks are not Okay sorry for the rant I ll cover one more point out of the Car Savior Complex Neglect of Public Transportation Dismissing the potential benefits of accessible public transportation shared mobility services or active transportation methods which can offer viable options for many people with disabilities We are privileged enough to be staying with my grandma who lives in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia Canada which is one of the few places in North America which has good accessible transit Despite not having a driver s license and my grandma not driving much with the wheelchair from my aunt I and my mom were able to see many places by using the bus and SkyTrain We went to the mall the park downtown etc all while my mom did not need to leave her wheelchair My mom has a greater appreciation for the transit system in BC because if we didn t have our bus and SkyTrain system we would be stuck at home Also I see many people and seniors use the SkyTrain with some of them riding very large and bulky mobility scooters like the heavy duty Shoprider Enduro XL https shoprider com products scooters enduro xl I doubt that these giant mobility scooters can fit inside a car but they fit inside the SkyTrain with minimal difficulties I ll take oversized mobility scooters over oversized pickup trucks any day of the week Needless to say for people with mobility requirements contrary to what car brained people who buy into the Car Savior Complex believe accessible transit provides these people with freedom and independence that car centric infrastructure can never provide Keep in mind I only covered the physical limitations of cars never mind the cognitive requirements needed to drive a car and how many people cannot safely operate a car even if they re physically able Are there improvements that transit can make Yes of course Apart from improving service and frequency transit should be wheelchair accessible with ramps and elevators and level boarding for trains Older transit systems need to be upgraded to be ADA or your country s equivalent compliant I m looking at you New York Subway With newer systems s onward they are built with accessibility in mind During my mother s recovery process we were able to go around with minimal difficulties The only minor issues we had were with the Mark I Mark II and Mark III SkyTrain on the Expo and Millennium Line as they re narrower due to their smaller loading gauge only meters wide and they use folding seats for the designated wheelchair areas But we had no issue with the Canada Line trains as they have a larger loading gauge at meters wide and have a wide empty space for wheelchair users If possible newer metro systems should be designed with a larger loading gauge of meters or more to allow for more room onboard Regardless while modern transit systems are designed to be accessible cars are not due to them being physically hard to get into and requiring a lot of cognitive function to operate What about these bidirectional low floor autonomous cars that look like pills Sure maybe in the future but that isn t coming soon And instead of having people travel far to get their basic needs shops and amenities should be close by where nobody has to walk far to get what they need Anyway I thought that I would share my story with you as while this topic has been covered before ever since helping my mom I ve become an advocate for accessibility so that everybody can enjoy all parts of life while being independent Take care"

something only known by its codename Operation Vacation Fortunately I have WiFi so you all have updates This begins the much requested Sifal spinoff continuing directly from the events of New York Carnival Chapter Some time has passed Sifal and Vriss have settled into their new roles within Isif s Rebellion and now they re about to make the most of the famed Arxur temperamental disposition towards independent autonomous action When First We Met Sifal https www reddit com r NatureofPredators comments yfq g new york carnival wherein an arxur first When Last We Left Sifal https www reddit com r NatureofPredators comments lf new york carnival an arxurs epilogue be the Next https www reddit com r NatureofPredators comments f m new years of conquest all the different and Memory Transcription Subject First Officer Sifal ARS Bleeding Heart Date standardized human time Various The funny thing about transfers of power is how much smoother they go when you re still visibly dripping with the blood of your predecessor Sure the usual handful of ambitious fools all spoke up each announcing that they alone deserved to be in charge but for each aspirant there was a full chorus of other soldiers screaming Fuck no absolutely not I think that might have been what fully sealed the deal for our new positions of power nobody particularly minded letting Vriss take charge The former first officer had a reputation for being orderly even keeled and just It was a wonderful upgrade over the previous captain s streaks of sadistic whimsy such a simple luxury knowing that you could evade all punishments just by following the rules And if the calmly efficient Captain Vriss wanted to pick that quiet but competent woman from engineering as his new first officer well nobody really minded me either and who knew efficiency better than an engineer As for the cause for rebellion itself a lot of the details were above our pay grade Vriss and I might have had broader visions of what the rebellion meant for the Arxur people but the average soldier mostly heard that their government Betterment was responsible for their hunger and their superior officer Chief Hunter Isif wanted to fix that and feed them People liked food and people liked that all they had to do to get it was to keep following the orders of the same commander they had followed for years In most ways as far as day to day life on our ship went nothing really changed The biggest difference frankly was practical after losing our stationary bases to attacks from Betterment and after pocketing the Human Venlil bounty on freed cattle we found ourselves swapping one resource scarcity for another Okay said Captain Vriss Run this by me again What do you mean we are out of hull patches The new head of engineering stared at the new Captain s feet nervously I never thought I would live to see the day that a man of such mediocre talents could eat well enough to become chubby but the fool s slight paunch was in its own way inspiring I m sorry Captain We haven t gotten a proper equipment resupply in months I tried to throw something together using scrap metal and solder but it s just not holding against the void of space His posture shrank down in shame and fear We just had to seal off the whole compartment It was just a bunk thankfully but a hit to anything important would be catastrophic at this point Vriss s gaze flicked over to me silently asking for my opinion on whether the engineer was full of shit or not I shrugged helplessly The man wasn t wrong about our supply issues and I d have probably tried a similar stopgap solution Alright said Vriss It is what it is Keep the ship steady I m going to confer with my first officer and see if we can conjure up a more long term solution Sifal my quarters I nodded and led the way I knew the path well Vriss s quarters were sparse and mostly book by population a deliberate affectation given the existence of holopads Most Arxur officers preferred ceremonial weapons and trophies so decorating his quarters in books made a fairly avant garde statement about what mattered to him Beyond that the room was furnished with a simple unordained desk a few sturdy chairs that were comfortable without being decadent shelves of clean metal bolted to the walls for stability and a firm bed that left space for more storage underneath I walked straight to the bed and sat near the head of it My captain shut the door behind him and laid down on the bed face up the back of his weary head resting on my lap All the food we could ever dream of and we re starved for scrap metal he said letting the exhaustion tinge his voice Rebellions rarely have the luxury of supplies of any sort I said gently massaging his head This kind of physical contact was our little indulgence behind closed doors Betterment never really condoned love and even within the rebellion cultural shifts took time The humans of America describe being short on food and materiel alike while wintering at Valley Forge during their own foundational rebellion Vriss s eyes winced shut The responsibility for the whole crew was an oppressive pressure He accepted it but he didn t enjoy it How did they win I exhaled trying to recall In that immediate position The Battle of Trenton A desperate night raid while their opponents were intoxicated and celebrating Vriss looked bemused Desperate raids are all we ve been doing We need a new approach if we re going to survive this He shook his head Anything else in your human texts With my free hand I retrieved my holopad and thumbed through my notes on Sun Tzu People hate it when you set their things on fire make sure your troops want the same things that you want consider the terrain when making plans stolen materiel is worth five times as much as domestically produced I trailed off the gears turning in my head Hey Vriss we re still technically at war with the Federation aren t we Vriss blinked I mean I suppose so What are you suggesting a cattle raid We don t need the food and it s probably still going to piss the U N off even if we re only targeting Federation outposts Right I said slowly the start of a plan taking shape But what if we don t raid them for cattle We need guns and ships Vriss raised an eyebrow Would prey built ships even be useful I shrugged For the spare parts Yeah they they might be The more I thought about it the more it all looked like it added up I mean a hull patch is a hull patch and our drive cores are all based on Kolshian tech anyway and it s not like prey built missiles share their owners cowardice Shit this could actually work We d need the perfect target though Vriss pointed out Federation run but far enough and small enough that the Kolshians would just write it off rather than pull forces away from the main war front to rescue them I flicked open a star map on my holopad and skimmed around rapidly until an outpost jumped out at me Here This one It s called It was some gibberish in a prey language so I just let it translate Seaglass Habitable planet cosmologically very young which means a higher concentration of the rarer minerals useful in starship manufacturing It s a Nevok owned mining outpost but the owners are Federation loyalists which makes them the worst of both worlds They ve refused human protection but their species accepted it so the Kolshians probably won t protect them either out of racist spite Perfect target Vriss nodded thinking So what s the actual plan then Smash and grab then scarper before the Federation or the Dominion notice we re there I considered it but there was a tiny flicker of inspiration drawing my attention to something I d read I flipped my holopad back over to my notes this time on human histories of warfare What if we took a cue from the Mongols I wondered aloud They started their campaign of conquests with raids but they rapidly switched up their strategies wherever they could get away with it I looked Vriss in the eyes They kept a network of tributaries to bankroll their ongoing war effort Low maintenance vassals Any time we show up the Feds fill our cargo holds with goods and in exchange we don t eat them Vriss s brow furrowed in confusion But I just said we probably can t get away with eating them I chuckled That s the best part they don t know that In fact if you look at how much trouble the humans have had with diplomacy I don t think the Feds would believe us if we told them They re just too convinced that we re all flesh starved monsters I drummed my fingers idly on the lean muscles of Vriss s chest Really convincing them that they can pay us off to spare them is going to be the hardest part I shrugged Guess we re about to see which Nevok instincts are stronger their fear of us or their love of a good deal Vriss snorted Your money or your life isn t that good of a deal Sifal Best deal we ve ever given them I said wryly Vriss considered the plan That covers the Federation he said but what happens if the Dominion catches us I pulled the star map back up The Dominion had cut our access to their spy stations obviously but the U N s cyber warfare specialists had quietly restored it at least in part Nevertheless It s a small colony I pointed out The nearest Dominion listening post is a few systems over monitoring a major trade hub If we approach Seaglass from the other side they won t even know we re there Suppose the Dominion is monitoring exports then said Vriss We knock the place over the exports drop or disappear The Dominion knows it wasn t them so they might send a scouting team to investigate just in case I shrugged Then they ll find an unremarkable Federation outpost that stopped exporting for some inscrutably prey brained reason What are they going to do talk to them Ask them if they ve been conquered lately I shook my head I don t think the Dominion would even suspect we re there Arxur and prey peacefully working together even under severe duress is unprecedented Vriss was running low on objections and he knew it as well What if they raid our new tributaries for cattle I laughed Worst case scenario we lose the colony and try again somewhere else Easy come easy go Best case scenario the raiders aren t prepared for any real resistance and we ambush them while they least expect it I could see the gears turning in Vriss s head Nodding decisively he sat up Alright that settles it then We ll give it a shot I ll coordinate attaining orbital superiority over the planet and you ll have command of the landing team I reared back in shock Whoa whoa whoa why are you giving me the command I ve never led a book club before let alone a landing team Vriss smiled and clapped me on the shoulder I ve been training you for months You re ready Besides it s your plan My eyes stayed wide I and you re not coming with Vriss shook his head Needing a babysitter would only undermine your authority Besides you re the right tool for this job For leading a ground assault I asked incredulously How do you figure My captain waved away my concerns Please We re Arxur Ground assaults against prey aren t that hard Trust me from experience you can pretty much make it up as you go along and still do fine Vriss looked at me dead on his golden eyes glistening in the dim light No you re the right choice for doing something as unprecedented and unconventional as negotiating actual terms of surrender with prey I m far too traditionally minded for this and you re the Terran trained social predator This is your mission First Officer Sifal He squeezed my shoulder one last time for reassurance I brushed it aside It was in my way as I went in for a full hug I tucked my maw down over his shoulder wrapping myself around him One more step towards our happy ending together I muttered into his upper back The first verse of our little call and repeat A clutch of fat hatchlings he replied and a farmhouse with a workshop And a cat I added petulantly as Vriss chuckled Days of preparation and travel passed Our small bomber wing dropped out of FTL closer to Seaglass than was typical The colony s primary defense was being too small to be worth the dignity or expense of raiding The whole world was just a couple sprawling company towns near the coast of a craggy supercontinent where the native life hadn t yet seen fit to crawl out of the sea If we hadn t been desperate to feed on its tight cluster of mines and factories this whole mission would have been a rounding error away from launching an orbital raid on one guy s house In short no they had no defensive perimeter of FTL inhibitors established yet On our side of the equation we weren t particularly interested in ramping up their fear of an inevitable defeat by sauntering into the system slowly We appeared in the sky in an instant and hit them hard and fast Very curiously to them we only hit their long range comm towers and we did so with surgical precision Orbit to ground railgun strikes like this were not standard Arxur procedure at all We had antimatter bombs for surface targets like that Nevertheless as their emergency sirens blared and as the prey scrambled to get their meager squadron of patrol craft off the ground every ship and bunker in the settlement screeched a warning for a missile targeting lock a promise to be kept at our leisure as we hailed them We broadcasted our intentions publicly while we awaited their response At my advisement there were no roaring growls in our ultimatum My lover spoke with the quietly menacing inevitability of a detonator slowly ticking down Federation Colony this is Captain Vriss of the Disruption Wing of the Arxur Rebellion Fleet We are assuming control over this outpost Stand down and your lives may yet be bargained for The word choice was a calculated half truth If we were very lucky the prey s thoughts would leap to the Human Venlil bounty on cattle That wasn t remotely what we had in mind here but it was a seed of hope for the prey below that they might survive long enough to be ransomed if they surrendered which well in a sense that part was true Vriss had primarily balked at the OpSec concerns of letting a whole planet know who we were but I assured him that for diplomacy to work they needed to see the faces and hear the names of their occupiers To accept us as their conquerors and rulers they first needed to accept us as people No one bowed to hungering beasts That being said we weren t so foolish as to sit around picking our teeth while we waited for their reply My ground squad was already in descent directly above the colony s main spaceport and command bunker It was perhaps a sign of poor redundancy planning keeping those two so close together but they d probably been the first sites constructed and hadn t yet been relocated I d been given command over an old cattle ship that had been hastily retrofitted as a resupply and tender ship and now hastily retrofitted back into something not entirely unlike an assault transport It had guns on it and could carry cargo and or people aplenty Its name had been something pointlessly cruel so I d hastily renamed it as well to the ARS Brennus It wasn t technically named after my human mentor David Brenner but I liked to imagine that it was Why Brennus asked Laza my second on the squad awkwardly pronouncing a name from a language and culture she d never studied We were all awkwardly gathered in the main cargo bay in full gear waiting for the ground to meet us It wasn t the worst time for a short speech Old human warlord who caught my interest while I was reading their histories I said I kept my voice casual but just loud enough to be overheard by anyone who wished to The city of Rome was the seat of power of a vast ancient human empire For nearly a thousand years from the city s founding to its fall it was conquered only once by some supposedly uncivilized barbarian named Brennus that Rome had underestimated I chuckled The city was forced to purchase his mercy with an astonishing weight in precious metals The barbarians made a grand show of it too They erected an enormous set of scales with weights on one side and space for their payment on the other When both sides of the scales were evened out the price was paid The Romans noticed however that the weights were heavier than agreed upon They tried to argue This is unfair they cried I slowly drew my fancy new ceremonial officer s sword holding its blade out before my eyes As David once did I could see every inch of my steel without taking my eyes off of the warrior in front of me Do you know what the great warlord Brennus said in response to their complaints I savored the eyes watching me with rapt attention I held my sword out by its hilt in front of me and let go It clattered to the ground loudly The few people who hadn t been paying attention jumped startled and I let my voice rise to a crescendo He dropped his sword atop the weights increasing the price of his mercy and said Vae victis Woe to the conquered An enthused cheer erupted from my assembled troops Gods of Old I could kiss David for the gifts of knowledge he d given me When you broke it down and explained it in writing the rhythm of a good rousing speech was practically a math formula Build up a beat raise the intensity ask a question pause for a breath and then let the answer hit them like a sledgehammer Gods everything the humans did was fucking music Start with the known and conventional then reverse it for dramatic effect The lives of the prey are forfeit this is true I shouted to the room But we do not want their lives Repeat the shape build upon the rhythm inherent in reversal We are here today not for their blood but for their steel Repetition repetition repetition What need have we for flesh We have eaten well today and we have eaten well yesterday and you may yet have faith that we will eat well tomorrow Build to the crescendo and then hit them with the one point that s not like the others It is their wealth today that we hunger for and their service towards our glorious cause Today we debut a new form of conquest Vriss was right I mused as I savored the roar of adulation from dozens of footsoldiers and tried to avoid recalling the Greco Roman concept of hubris Leading a ground assault against the prey is really fucking easy"

tactical MMORPG that will release a server you can play on soon Everyone will be back at starting level and modifications will be done to make the game more socially interesting or at least it s constructed to make the players interact way more as it is necessary in general Obviously you can still play alone If you need informations on what the heck is that game check the post or check their website https www wakfu com en mmorpg https www wakfu com en mmorpg amp x B amp x B Greeting fellow gamers Buckle up this is a long one amp x B First of all I m French so my english might be faulty sometimes I apologize Hope it will still be understandable Introduction and why I m here I ve been following this sub from afar for quite some time Like a lot of you hoping to find MMORPG s suggestions to clench my thirst A few weeks ago Wakfu the MMORPG I grew up on announced a special server opening and A LOT of old players and new players alike are rejoining the game to play it Those servers are special They are called mono account They DO NOT ALLOW multi accounts on the same IP with some lee way for brothers sisters etc Do not worry What is meant is you don t play yourself multiple accounts or characters It is a mechanic that pretty much taken for granted on that game which reduced heavily the interactions with other players The game is built around groups and having to play together and especially communicate together no automatic dungeon party for example It is well known by the developer and the players that people tend to have multiple account to be their own play buddy Even the developer allowed you to play up to characters of the same account at the same time Just open other windows and play them all together in a team Since it s a tactical turn based game that s not an issue That specific new server does not allow that bringing back that sweet sweet social right back into the game There is currently around people that announced in a public poll from the game vompany themselves they would at least try that new server rd of that are french rd are international players They will have one server dedicated to each third so french and one international amp x B amp x B Why am I doing this probably long post Because I want to put that game forward internationally It s a very well known game in France and would greatly benefit from and to international players because it kinda is a one of a kind experience I m going to try to be expansive on the content of the game so you know what we are dealing with amp x B NOTE I m not paid influencer or even linked to that game ever I m just a big fan and think that kind of posts on that subreddit should become the norm Passionate people talking about their favorite MMORPGs getting more people into it The more the merrier NOTE I wrote this post on a whim I m not that good at organizing information nor explaining things I hope you will be able to feel the passion more than read it Please try the game s for yourself NOTE Sorry all the screenshots are in French and my english is broken Ankama games and the Krosmoz Ankama games is a French studio that have been very active for the past years With currently MMORPG s still running and going strong under their belt they are the Jagex Runescape equivalent in France A gigantic impact on a particular generation and a loved video games company by players They spent a lot of time carefully crafting an original universe based on a temporality that globally makes sense monsters gods and explaining in universe the origin of the different roles healer dpt etc by the use of classes You can check their universe wiki on this website https krosmoz fandom com wiki Krosmoz https krosmoz fandom com wiki Krosmoz This creation is so expansive that they were able to base tons of games on it multiple movies and multiples animated shows The stories of Kerubim Wakfu the animated serie available on Netflix at least french netflix and I think US aswell Judith the movie with another one on the way P S I highly recommend the Wakfu show just for the excellent writing in particular on the villain side The animation is special and need some time to get used to but trust me the writing of those villains is exquisite Especially if you long villains having actual motives you can relate to Basic gameplay system This part is more of a warning I will present the BASICS you will find in all MMORPG I ll be talking about in this post They WILL have differences that I ll go expansively in details on in the different sections Those games are ISOMETRIC TURN BASED GAMES They are MEANT to be a tactical strategic experience to their core Screenshot from Wakfu with a tactical visual mode https preview redd it d ayzh zczub png width amp format png amp auto webp amp s d f eccd db cc f f b e d amp x B All those games work in a grid like system You play your turn spend your movement points near the center in green spend your action points near the center in dark blue special points in light blue end your turn let the other play the AI play and it s your turn again Rince and repeat until one team is dead life of your character on the hearth in the middle The green bar is irrelevant here Pretty simple right You need to enjoy that idea if you want to enjoy those games because it will be hard to avoid Unless you just fully roleplay in that case who cares about mechanics The universe genre and that system are what s common between those games Most of the other mechanics even down to the kind of spell you can launch are different Let s get into the specifics now Dofus Dofus is their first MMORPG It is placed at the beginning of the timeline story wise You can see Dofus like OSRS It s old graphics it s very farm intensive but still going strong very strong I highly recommend checking it out even if I m here to talk more about it s spiritual successor will talk more about why there are quotation marks later Dofus has a lot of old games mechanics It is meant to be exact predictable Every damage is precisely calculated The world is not continuous but rather a collection of little squares stuck together to form a coherent ensemble You go from map to map essentially with a fixed camera for each map To be honest I barely touched that game So I m not that qualified to talk about it It is a very interesting game still and has the most active community of them all Just know that it will probably be mostly french as this game has very little international community Wakfu and Waven are different the first because of the show mostly and the second because it s built this way amp x B Starting zone of Dofus https preview redd it nck qperdzub png width amp format png amp auto webp amp s e b a b f e ff b cd amp x B A fight https preview redd it voi rudzub png width amp format png amp auto webp amp s c b c e b a ac b Wakfu This is why I made this post so I m going to be very thorough Classes amp Combat https www wakfu com en mmorpg encyclopedia classes https www wakfu com en mmorpg encyclopedia classes In this game there is no warrior mage archer exactly Well there is but it s more for the sake of having them rather than making them the center piece The whole game is built on a plethora of classes and ALL OF THEM are viable options There is no perfect response not even in the playstyle mostly because the game is way too big for one playstyle to win in every situation Classes are mostly differentiated by their role support dps distance dps melee boost placement etc their playstyle and the level of tactics you have to engage to play them Example Cra is on appearance a very easy class to play It s a classic archer very good in DPS You can just hit the enemy with some arrows spells and end it at that You can also use beacons and shoot them so it hits in a zone You can also play it as a kite Overall a pretty easy class but like all of them easy to play hard to master Technically a good option to start the game Xelor is another class you can play They are a mage that controls time essentially They will spend most of their time managing their action points removing them to others adding some more to themselves Play with a mechanic where they do more damage only on turns that are even turn etc mimicking a clock Osamodas is a class of summoner where you have to capture ACTUAL MONSTERS in the game fight them like pokemon so they end up in your deck You will then be able to use their ability to fight whatever you want later You have a lot of abilities to boost your invocations but can also have the playstyle where you totally forget about using summons boost yourself transform into a dragon and hit like a truck amp x B The versatility of classes the amount of care the developers have put into every single mechanic to make them all feel like unique classes and playstyle it s just absolutely gorgeous to see Being able to witness a class Eniripsa who is BUILT to be a healer being played as offensive because of ONE OPTIONAL SPELL that transform every healing capability into an damaging one at the drop of a hat and being the most broken damaging class in PvP at some point That s just a treat When you witness that kind of gameplay you just end up in awe of how weird that game how complex and how optimized and inventive people can be Since I play that class I can show you what Xelor looks like amp x B A xelor turn https preview redd it cs eqsiizub png width amp format png amp auto webp amp s cd fb ee ad e ad f c ec e afbe f You probably do not understand anything but a whole lot is going on At the bottom the available spells Damage description effects range cost everything is written there It s how and when you use them that s important For the Xelor

matters You will take more damage if you re hit from the back or from the side Every class has passive spells aswell see below They are tailored to CHANGE THE GAMEPLAY OF YOUR CLASS IN A DEEP WAY Hence why I said earlier you will NEVER see two people play exactly the same way They will have different gear different spell deck or different passives or even bonuses on their gear you don t have

that has been covered in recent updates years ago is fine a bit long That s where you actually find out it s a pure multiplayer game and leveling up alone become actually difficult same as before

people don t and don t need to have most of their jobs to the max level I just enjoy that part of the game especially This is not a normal beginner account Also very old player that helps to know some methods techniques In terms of economy it s very simple Complete quests or sell stuff on the market place or craft money by itself with the mining job The economy is still manageable and not hyper inflated with absolute last gear content fully optimized which requires that exact same extremely rare item times or to be destroyed for parts used to upgrade the one sold amounting to around millions and the market place quickly going down the millions range as soon as you check the th most priced items on there Hope that makes sense again not english native A screenshot of the marketplace It goes

Griefers amp PK are NOT a problem that exists in that game Personalization amp cosmetics This game has tons of fun things attached to it s personalization system First obvisouly you can personalize

Furniture is yours to build or to buy in game Upgrading your personal home is stupidly easy in game You can only upgrade the size pretty much Guilds and everything related to them are related to

mechanic to learn and master it s rarely only As long as you hit enough you win It s a tactic game after all Sometimes you will have to be in certain locations have certain items hit with certain elements to make the dungeon possible And obviously the more end game a dungeon gets the more complicated the mechanics gets as well One very interesting addition that Wakfu has made and that I ve seen nowhere is the system of Stasis named after the energy of destruction in opposite of wakfu which is the energy of creation in that universe What it does is that it boost monsters add new mechanics to a dungeon And it can go up to stasis considering putting a dungeon stasis is boosting health points by and damage by and the loot by Better than that you can play a dungeon in competitive mode or in modulated mode forcing your character to level down temporarily to the level of the dungeon and yet you still make experience that would level up your real level Now EVERY DUNGEON in the game is interesting to do whatever level you have Do you want to play with your beginner friends Just level down your character temporarily and play at their level You will always have a challenge even with the lowest dungeons in your end game Always Monetization The moment everyone has been waiting for It s an important case and I ll be honest on this one This game is not pay to win There are a few things that might be suspicious at first The most obvious being the possibility of buying in game currency wih real money you buy an item with real money that grants you shop currency and sell it for in game currency Trust me It s absolutely not game breaking and usually barely worth it for the seller That system is actually very interesting because it gives you shop currency to buy stuff without spending a cent on the game for a price that s very achievable as long as you know the economy what you are doing It s kinda like World of Warcraft tokens but supercharged since you can spend that on whatever you want in the shop A booster see below cosmetics or whatever Other than that it s mostly pure cosmetic shop The few items that could give an advantage The biggest bag to carry more items for example have an equivalent you can craft and are very easily buyable on the marketplace or even in the actual shop if you buy shop currency to someone who sells it for in game currency You can also buy more storage in your personal house Storage is to me the most game breaking part of all because I m a resource gatherer and collector and that game is so massive it s hard to have the room to store all of my things resources For normal players what s given for free is fine You can also buy ways to level up your pets faster or some experience bottle to get a temporary boost but let s be honest both are clearly not worth it and barely sells That game is FREE TO PLAY ALL UPDATES ARE FREE WITHOUT EXCEPTION NO EXTENSION OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT You can buy a booster that will boost in a very significant way the leveling process both in jobs and in levels You will also have a chance of getting more loot You also get access to the system that allows you to play up to characters on the same account It also allows you to restat for free indefinitely something you can do without booster in the game by following a quest that asks you quite a long farm or a bit of money if you buy the items you need to complete the quest What I want to say is that the booster is not a necessity it s an actual help Not a masquerade of You can do something in that game but you will have to farm years to get it kind of way The booster does what his name implies It boosts you It doesn t give you access to anything that is locked either soft or hard by playing without booster It s sold around per month and around of those items you can buy for in game currency to obtain shop currency It tends to become necessary close to the end of the game for most people because the leveling can get rough and quite long but to be absolutely honest most people just don t use everything they have With all the daily quests available the dungeons the guilds etc you can easily level up quite efficiently again if you know what you re doing without having to pay a single cent And AGAIN you can buy that booster with shop currency which can be bough with in game currency and is quite affordable NOTE On the mono account server the booster lose the access to the system of playing multiple characters of the same account at the same time for obvious reasons and insteand bumps up the experience in jobs and levels bonuses Waven I will not talk extensively of that game It s still a beta it s not really a MMORPG even if it claims it is it does not play like one and feels more like a very individual mobile experience I would not really recommend it Still a great and cute game it looks gorgeous but it still need a whole lot of work Which makes sense it s their last and most recent game End word Thank you for reading Please give a try to those games Especially Wakfu Still wanted to mention the existence of the others just in case you could be interested but let s be honest I m a Wakfu enjoyer Don t hesitate to reach out I ll happily answer questions in the comment I barely play on the international server and will probably not play on the international version of that new mono account server But who knows maybe But if you long social interactions from the past and cry out for interesting options that give you that nostalgic feeling back trust me it might be it"

earth is a lost colony Next https www reddit com r HFY comments d zj earth is a lost colony Chapter Four New Enemy Same War Sergeant Kaydanovsky now Cadet Kaydanovsky had just been given a great honor Fifteen million other soldiers had also received this honor One month ago the nations these soldiers had fought for had all joined forces when the Protectorate of Earth was officially formed Resistance was fierce for the first few weeks and the move to integrate all of Earth s nations was hardly popular but that was the Coalition doctrine Vitram thankfully had managed to salvage the situation with her diplomatic skills and the help of newly promoted Protectoral Governor Aavik Admiral Jedik s plan to put power armored marines on every street corner and integrate humanity by force was disregarded as too aggressive Instead Vitram chose to use soft power the kind not even a thousand warships could properly project She brokered peace deals that while never entirely satisfactory did wonders to ease international tensions She rewarded nations that supported her with technology resources and other favors She let the UN with a host of newly acquired powers be her boots on the ground rather than deploying an occupation force herself The one thing the Republic was unashamed to do on its own was provide aid to those in need distributing medicine food and other essential supplies to where they were needed most It would have been political suicide to integrate every nation into the Republic The bad blood between them would have thrown the Protectorate into a civil war and indeed small scale conflicts were already raging Instead what Vitram and Aavik agreed on was to make the Protectorate a coalition of independent nations that all worked toward a common goal There was still conflict but Vitram had made it absolutely clear that the Alliance was the greater evil here That along with a strong central authority to keep peace made sure this conflict was resolved with words and not weapons The Republic s arrival had made poverty and hunger things of the past on Earth They had bolstered the United Nations making it a central authority strong enough to resolve disputes between nations but not strong enough to stifle their freedom They had intervened only when necessary to stop bloodshed or suffering and they had never attempted to oppress the people of Earth or cow them with military might Vitram s promise held true in that the freedoms Earth s nations held were restricted as little as possible In the most cooperative cases there were no restrictions at all There were no jackbooted marines on every corner There were no public executions or mass arrests There were no mysterious disappearances or tragic accidents even to those who staunchly opposed the new Earth All in all Kaydanovsky approved of his new overlords An unintended side effect of said overlords arrival was a massive increase in certain types of art which the Republic took with a collective tired sigh Some things were inevitable A very much intended effect of the Ierads arrival was the modernization of Earth s economy government and military which the Republic had directly caused The inefficient and competitive bureaucracy that had existed between Earth s nations was replaced with a smooth cooperative Coalition method of doing things While modernizing every last factory and farm on Earth would take at least a year logistics was something that could be instantly improved The very first field to see the results of these upgrades was that of the military since that was the sole reason the Republic came at all The Protectorate of Earth was under Republic protection hence the name and that was evident in the way said Republic was aiding its growth The planetary militaries of Earth were split between a garrison force and an expeditionary force and both were being modernized and trained by the RDF Orbital infrastructure was even now being set up to support the fielding of a space navy and pre made defensive platforms were being set up in high orbit of Earth as a flimsy screen against any assault Coalition or otherwise The Ierad Republic trusted the people of Earth now officially called Terrans out of necessity Most of the Coalition did not trust them at all Even still most species were logical enough to see the reason in letting others fight their battles for them They wished the Republic the best in its efforts even while they rallied an extermination fleet in case it should fail While a thousand mighty warships held point in orbit of Alpha Centauri five hundred hulking troopships hurtled through their wormholes to the fortress world of Iera Prime Cadet Kaydanovsky as well as fifteen million other soldiers were packed like sardines inside those troopships The world dropped out from underneath him all of a sudden as it did for the crews and cargo of a thousand Republic heavy troop transports Large enough to eclipse even the most formidable battleship interstellar troopships were meant to transport as many soldiers as possible as fast as possible to the front lines of the war They could fit even small warships into their colossal cargo holds and their troop transport decks could transport thirty thousand soldiers at a time They were built solely for speed and cargo space sparing no space for defensive armaments or even any comforts beyond the most basic A good Aegis generator was too expensive to qualify and so Kaydanovsky nearly hurled as he was ripped back into our universe Breathe man breathe said a fellow soldier He was originally from the Latvian special forces and his nation had suffered for centuries under the Russian yoke but there was no sense of animosity between the two They were brothers in arms now bound by a sense of duty to their new nation as well as a common enemy Did you take your pill Wormhole travel was the only reasonable way to cross the void between stars but that did not change the fact that it was unspeakably dangerous The calculations involved with plotting a jump needed to be precise down to the last decimal place or else a ship could find itself light years off course Jumping too close to a star would probably spell disaster for any starship even with the most precise of calculations The jump itself was even more harrowing since jumping through an artificial wormhole was like stabbing a hole in the universe and popping out of the other end They were notoriously unstable and while the first few test ships mostly made it back to our world not one returned intact The universe apparently did not like being stabbed Ships with a crew of hundreds returned unmanned Sturdy bulkheads and beams became twisted into each other melding in ways unexplainable by science Even the most hardened of computer banks returned from an unprotected jump completely wiped Were it not for the deficient minds of the Coalition s species a wormhole jump gone wrong would ve been the subject of many a horror movie Only after the Krell Empire developed the Aegis Project and later the Aegis fields did wormhole travel become safe Even still troopships Aegis fields were just strong enough to keep them from returning as a lump of misshapen scrap that had obviously clashed violently with the laws of physics Wormhole travel can affect a ship even with the strongest of Aegis fields protecting it and while this effect is unnoticeable withdrawal from it is usually harmful to an organism s psyche Within a decade pills were developed to ease this effect into something manageable Cadet Kaydanovsky did not take his pill He hurled A strained What do you think came out of his mouth immediately after his lunch I ll uh I ll call the janitor Kaydanovsky left shortly afterward seeing the wisdom in not being at the scene of his crime He joined the rest of his ragtag platoon in assembling in the main cargo hold Rank after rank of soldiers all hailing from somewhere in Eastern Europe held formation in a dull utilitarian room stretching three kilometers It was nearly the whole length of the ship RDF drill instructors paced catwalks above the cadets scrutinizing them intensely for any flaws Like birds of prey they stood poised to swoop on anyone who showed weakness Fall in you sack of shit Kaydanovsky had heard that before Move or I ll shove this baton up your monkey ass That was a new one though It was a tradition in the Republic for those charged with disciplining their fellow soldiers such as military police or drill instructors to carry batons while on duty This harkened back centuries to when the batons were originally used for corporal punishment While MPs and RDF Order enforcers carried very real and very powerful stun batons however the one worn by the sergeant above Kaydanovsky was purely ceremonial The Russian cadet couldn t have known that so the threat implied by waving said baton in the air seemed very real He fell in line with the rest of his platoon and the squawking was redirected at some other hapless soul Kaydanovsky like all his comrades and a rapidly increasing amount of Earth s citizens had undergone surgery to get a translation chip installed in his brain There was technically a language called Galactic Standard but it was purely in writing and only used by snobbish diplomats Translators could handle text just as well so nobody else felt the need to bother using it The inventors of said language were too dead to care All cadets attention That announcement didn t come from any of the roving drill instructors instead booming from a series of compact loudspeakers around the cavernous cargo hold Captain on deck Kaydanovsky and his comrades snapped to attention In the oversight deck overlooking the cargo hold the captain of the troopship straightened out her feathers and began to speak Attention cadets I am Captain Verilek You will address me and every other member of the Republic Defense Force as sir until you have earned the right to say otherwise Let me make this clear cadets you are no longer civilians Your rights as a soldier are lesser than those of a Republic civilian Your rights as a cadet are privileges and they can be revoked When you are told anything by an officer you will respond with Yes sir No sir or I don t know sir Am I clear The sound of thirty thousand voices screaming Yes sir echoed through the cargo hold Captain Verilek didn t hear a peep through the bulletproof glass windows I expected nothing less said the captain Once this troopship lands the doors at the front of the hold will open You will march in formation until your forwardmost rank has reached the red line at the end of the parade field Then you will stop and you will stand at attention until directed otherwise Not one of you will become a soldier until you start acting like one All of them were soldiers Emphasis on were They were well suited to fighting since they were still trained soldiers but they would require days of training before they could use the advanced equipment fielded by RDF Planetary and the other Coalition militaries For a grand total of one standard week which was somehow completely identical to one Earth week Cadet Kaydanovsky and his fifteen million comrades were going to train under Republic officers until they were skilled enough to serve under those officers in combat The troopship set down smoothly Proper suspension was surprisingly important enough to be included in its design The door slid open seconds later and the drill instructors began barking orders Cadet Kaydanovsky was among the last of the th Terran Expeditionary Infantry to march standing straight and at attention onto the soil of an alien world Ierad cities were a beautiful sight to see with even the dullest of their buildings being curved and elegant and the most beautiful ones making even a king s palace look like an impoverished slum in comparison Engineering and architecture were common pursuits for those blessed with a creative mind second only to the military and the result of that could be seen in Republic design doctrine Public transportation was commonplace removing the need for cars and so all the space that would have been taken by streets and intersections was instead used to build beautiful parks playgrounds and monuments to some of the Republic s heroes The capital of Iera Prime uninventively named Epicenter was a work of art bigger than New York Even the behemoth climate control plants that dotted every Coalition world keeping them carbon neutral were painted green and white to blend in seamlessly with the environment around them The few Ierads who could imagine such beauty were smart enough to record how to achieve it thus immortalizing their legacy and ensuring the Republic s dominance in the art world for centuries to come Unfortunately Cadet Kaydanovsky was not marching through Epicenter or any Ierad city He was in what was once the garrison base of the st Rapid Response Mechanized Unit but it had been repurposed as a training ground when the st was deployed to the conflict on the colony world of Atreides Ierad military bases as well as the fortifications surrounding their cities were starkly utilitarian There was still a certain beauty in the way they were arranged how their armor sloped and curved fluidly and how their cannons merged seamlessly with the structures supporting them but the RDF prioritized function over form and not the other way around As it was the parade field of Sector Defense Firebase was nothing special Cadet Kaydanovsky and his comrades marched on plain white tarmac designed to reflect heat and keep soldiers feet from burning The human troops were clad in plain grey the standard uniform of RDF cadets They would earn their black uniforms when they became true soldiers Platoon halt Kaydanovsky and his unit stopped as one Right face They executed a picture perfect turn to face another platoon that was marching away from them Kaydanovsky s unit followed Soon enough they were lined up in formation in front of an Ierad lieutenant in full RDF black He paced back and forth inspecting his men A pistol hung at his side but no baton was visible I am Wing Lieutenant Kryll Naxol your new commander he snapped His feathers were jet black blending well with his military uniform He wore many medals on his chest each one a gleaming sign of his valor under fire I will make an exception for this platoon and this platoon only to address me as Wing Lieutenant Naxol or simply Lieutenant Naxol or Wing Lieutenant This is because I am not only your commander but your comrade You will all serve alongside me on the front lines and if what I am told is true you will be the finest soldiers in the Republic Cadet Lieutenant Naxol read Kaydanovsky s name tag Kaydanovsky That s Chinese if I remember correctly It was Russian and Naxol knew that He was testing the cadet gauging whether or not he would correct a superior officer That was all part of the standard training doctrine Kaydanovsky fidgeted awkwardly not wishing to incur Naxol s wrath by correcting him He failed the test Answer honestly and quickly or not at all Lieutenant Naxol advised him No sir It s Russian sir Understood said the lieutenant Step forward Kaydanovsky did step forward and he saluted Lieutenant Naxol I did not tell you to salute me cadet snapped the officer Drop and give me forty Forty ships made up an RDF Space strike group Forty soldiers made up an RDF Planetary platoon Ierads had a strange fascination with the number forty Kaydanovsky dropped to the ground and began hammering out pushups and Lieutenant Naxol addressed the entire platoon I may be your comrade in arms but I am also your commander I am in charge of whipping you into fighting shape so you may have the honor of giving your lives for the Republic He looked down at Cadet Kaydanovsky pointing his right eye at the huge Russian man Ierads were like chameleons in that their eyes could move independently of each other Cadet Kaydanovsky are you paying attention Yes Wing Lieutenant Excellent I would hate to give you another forty The lieutenant looked back at the thirty nine soldiers in front of him I am no coward nor am I a sloth The word Naxol used referred to an Ieran animal that could gather nutrients via crude photosynthesis and had no natural predators so it gained a reputation as lazy since it rarely ate or moved That word was unpronounceable by anyone except Ierads so it was translated to mean sloth I will train alongside you and I will set an example for you to follow Should I fail in this it is your duty to set me straight I will do likewise for you Lieutenant Naxol pointed a single claw at Kaydanovsky who was already halfway done with his punishment I am in charge of this platoon and so I am responsible for its failures Should a single cadet or a small group step out of line they will be disciplined individually However if this platoon as a unit fails I will share in its punishment Don t mess up That last sentence got a snicker out of one cadet and Naxol made sure he regretted it Step forward and give me forty cadet The cadet seeing no other options hurried to obey Naxol s order If you think training is funny you ll be laughing your beak off when you are deployed to combat Unfortunately for all of us it is not You are here to fight against fascism just like your grandfathers and grandmothers did in the Great Patriotic War and I expect you to honor their memories enough to not want to disappoint them Naxol was briefed on Russia s military history before he was assigned to this unit He knew enough about his new underlings to fit in and establish a brotherly camaraderie but not much else All of you arrange yourselves into squads of ten said the lieutenant Report to the rifle range within five standard minutes in full formation and military dress or it s another forty for all of us Dismissed With that Lieutenant Naxol walked off to the rifle range It was six minutes walk away Forty push ups an exercise that the RDF had blatantly stolen from human militaries were in his future Boot camp had just begun First https www reddit com r HFY comments pe x earth is a lost colony Previous https www reddit com r HFY comments ty h earth

        "cleaned_text": "There are many things I loved about the city but several I did not like and I think it is worth mentioning for when it s time to choose the next tourist destination It is very crowded with both locals and tourists and many times it feels hectic much more like a Middle Eastern city than a European one People push into each other in public crowded spaces and there is no notion of personal space I watched the taxi drivers changing lanes all the time impatiently breaking and accelerating all the time Public transportation is also crowded and feels unpleasant Shuttle vans other than the crazy driving use the AC intermittently despite the heat of the summer As a tourist you can expect people will want to scam you somewhere Not always there are many great people but often you would find sellers who want to take advantage of you There is this opinion that things are not great economically in Turkey foreigners have money so it is fair to make foreigners pay more to compensate for the economic problems of the country People smoke everywhere There is a terrible disrespect for the others if they are non smokers Kids pregnant women it does not matter if they are exposed There are many good restaurants we loved a little one next to the AirBNB with great food and a friendly owner but in the touristy areas food is bad and expensive Many restaurants are dirty just take a look at the kitchen and bathroom and expect the same in the way food was prepared There is a fascinating ignorance towards the Byzantine history of the city As a reminder Constantinople was conquered in after years of history as one of the greatest cities in the world It was the capital of the Roman Empire longer than Rome History before is briefly presented and people want to make it look like Istanbul is the creation of the Ottoman Empire It was sad to see workers digging around the Milion Stone one of the most important sites in the history of the world without any concern about destroying the archeological evidence around it It was sad to see the last orthodox icon inside Hagia Sofia covered The history of Byzantine Empire is only interesting to people when it can be monetized And lastly the airport is poorly organized and Turkish Airlines staff while not rude has no intention of smiling or making you feel they care about the customers"

        "cleaned_text": "Just One Drop Ch You Simply Must Stay amp x B Bherdin D saari was practically vibrating as Tom scanned the foot traffic leaving Exit Terminal Races of all sorts dotted the mostly Shil vati crowd and Bherdin was craning his neck as best he could to spot his family Funnily enough it was Tom who spotted them first Maybe it was the knot of Humans in the group though it was probably his friend s extra height He followed Tom s gaze when his friend nodded up the causeway Is that them It took a moment for a knot of Tauri to amble out of the way before he saw them and his heart fluttered in his chest Oh Oh my yes The flutter settled bathed in a warm glow of satisfaction Thry sis had put on weight The poor dear still looked much herself and was shepherding her kho wives poor Brelak and a host of others along in her wake Her business suit was a bit bedraggled doubtless from all the strain Bherdin felt his spirits rise and he waved delicately as he stepped out to catch their eye Akitai glanced his way said something to Miara and moments later they began heading in his direction Thankfully Tom had the connections to get a sizable transport Melondi was over with Vedeem and his son watched uncertainly They had poor Celani to consider but there were plenty of women to manage Not that Thry sis ever minded organizing The stars would go out before Oh you poor dears Welcome home Bherdin reached out to embrace Brelak fondly before stepping back There was a small throng of children gathered about and he gave them all a welcoming smile as he took inventory Tom was exchanging nods with the eldest Human male in Thry sis group but there simply wasn t time to watch how they greeted one another in the wild Trik sis and Solanna had certainly grown and Rhe alla hovered protectively close to a Human man and woman each of whom held a small child in their arms That made the young man near her Jacarin and he d grown up into a fine Oh dear Well there s no accounting for taste out in the colonies Shopping later There was always time for shopping and with luck he might get Tom to come Clothing aside they all looked quite well and he braced himself as Thry sis made her way over allowing himself to be briefly embraced Cousin It s so good to be home Thry sis stood back and looked him over briefly before taking in the group And this must be Vedeem Introductions later You all must be perfectly exhausted and we simply must get you home Bherdin straightened his jacket It was taffeta after all though Brelak looked tired and wouldn t judge Still when one was out in public the public eye We ve substantial transportation arranged with Ms Ton is here to help drive us home Of course and it s good to see you employing the disabled Thry sis stepped over to give Celani an approving nod It s a pleasure to meet you It s such a relief to see a woman looking after my cousin Men of his age need someone about and are you a veteran too That s exactly the sort of thing my administration takes care of back on Earth I m sure Miara will have a hundred questions for you and perhaps something can be done to get you a reliable prosthetic Of my age You turox Any burgeoning desire to scratch her eyes out was cast aside as Thry sis turned back Oh and you brought a girl to help That s thoughtful The girls and I have been trying to take care of Brelak but it was such a tiring trip Bherdin watched as Thry sis D saari his beloved cousin and scion of House D saari unceremoniously dropped her carry on bag into Melondi s arms with barely a glance Thank you young lady There were moments when the universe held its breath When the Goddess looked down upon the affairs of mortals to intervene Bherdin watched his son s eyes go wide as Princess Khelira Tasoo heiress to the Duchy of Varkeif and the Eastern Palace opened her mouth then closed it again shouldering the bag Thry sis was already in her element Come on everyone The baggage carousel should be just this way Every so often the Goddess was kind The universe let the matter go and Bherdin remembered to breathe He closed ranks with Brelak and the entire throng of his family clan began moving He d managed at least a dozen steps in his cousin s wake when the loudspeaker sounded over the terminal Gentlemen and ladies Gentlemen and ladies Your attention please All terminal traffic will shut down in three hours to clear local airspace for priority arrival The report has just arrived from Space Traffic Control Home Fleet has returned Terminal through will be cleared for personnel transfer and resupply Please conclude your business Alternate landing for inbound cargo will be posted Thank you for your cooperation Bherdin glimpsed the expression on Melondi s face The Goddess had a sense of humor but it wasn t always kind Levi took a deep breath adjusted Joshua s weight in his arms and tried to relax as the family began moving through the massive starport It wasn t the size of the crowd that set alarm bells ringing in the back of his head though he was certainly no fan of crowds It wasn t even how many of them were staring That was just a thing Shil vati did No most of them were staring at Josh and Cassie He glanced over at the girl nestled in Melody s arms just in time to watch a pair of gray skinned humanoids with horns and glowing lines criss crossing their exposed skin as they walked past They stared wide eyed at the infant and then turned and began jabbering excitedly in a language he didn t understand looking back all the while Easy dude Let s bring the paranoia down a notch or two hmm Thry sis was in rare form this morning issuing instructions and treading on proverbial toes with all the blustering self assuredness she d had when he d first met her Bherdin the cousin who was here to pick them all up had looked homicidal for a moment during the conversation between Thry sis and the rather military looking woman with one arm The Human who d introduced himself to Zachariah as Tom Warrick wore a long suffering expression accented by the occasional wince Even the girl she d dumped her bag on seemed utterly flabbergasted before making a quick recovery Speaking of which Hey bud he addressed the boy in his arms as they approached the baggage carousel I need you to go to Mama Rhe for me okay Joshua nodded and Levi handed him off to his Shil vati wife who immediately began pointing out cool stuff to him The two were soon engrossed in the holographic advertisements that floated near the room s ceiling Mentally shifting gears Levi walked over to where the young lady was holding Thry sis bag with a bemused expression Pardon me He stifled a wince at the thickly accented Vatikre coming out of his mouth but soldiered on I wanted to say sorry for Lady D saari She means well but is well she is a noble He held out a hand I can take it if you like The girl blinked in surprise then waved dismissively No no it s fine I was just surprised But thank you for the offer Mr I am Levi He turned and waved a hand at the girls Those are my wives Melody and Rhe alla And thank you your grace The girl stumbled W what Sorry Thank you for your grace Levi gave her an apologetic grimace Sorry I m learning still much of the language Thank you for um being graceful Being kind about the mother of my wife Oh Ohhh I understand She gave a quiet laugh and a shake of her head My name is Melondi You said Levi Rhe alla and Melody right You said they re both your wives I did He glanced at her out of the corner of his eye I m afraid that I am looking not for a third kho if that is what you really wanting to know Melondi gave a polite snort of laughter Does that come up often All the time I think it is more kindest to say it up front No need to worry about me Levi she assured him with a smile May I ask about your little ones The bigger one is Joshua and the discount one is Cassandra How old are they They look small Four and two That would be a little over one and two in Shil vati years But they re so tiny Shil vati women are big They make big babies Human women are small They make small babies The rumble of the luggage conveyor drew his attention Levi shrugged and gave her a rueful grin But please excusing me while I grab my bag Pleased to meeting you The D saari women were already pulling the suitcases and bags off as the carousel as it homed in on the signals from their omni pads Levi ignored the looks from other passengers as he slipped through the crowd snagging the bags of his wives and children In short order he had a duffle bag slung over each shoulder a suitcase in each hand and was plodding back toward his family Rhe alla laughed as he lumbered up All in one trip Always Melody nodded back the way he d come from You made quite an impression for yourself back there Turning to look over his shoulder he stifled a groan There were easily two dozen Shil vati a couple of bug things and something that looked for all the world like a Naga all staring at him with wide eyes They hastily looked away with expressions ranging from chagrin to blue faced embarrassment And here I was thinking the staff of the star liner were thirsty Melody shrugged Well you are something of a rarity sweetie What do you mean Look around There are more men here with us in our group than I ve seen since we left Earth Melody gave an artful shrug of her shoulders but it was her bemused smile that told him he d missed the broad side of the barn And you should have let us get all the bags Levi rested one of the duffles against an ornate bronze trash bin and turned scanning the bustling concourse with a growing sense of astonishment Apart from the species that were utterly unrecognizable to him he counted a grand total of three men Two Shil vati males both with a bevy of vigilant women around them and a Raikiri who looked like he could go toe to toe with the Hulk for at least thirty seconds A moment later the cylinder slid away and rotated a filmy red eye peering out at him through a slit in the top Levi leapt back in alarm as it burbled something at him harshly then turned and trundled toward the exit we re definitely not in Kansas anymore Jama sighed as he looked over the reports on Earth It was disheartening after so long a road to reach this point but the partisans springing up around Denver needed to be taught a lesson He d seen this behavior before Left unchecked resistance fighters would start springing up in the midwestern part of the continent creating a domino effect throughout the territory The clear move was to use the marines to ferret them out It was disappointing but there were few alternatives He looked at the report again and shrugged The locals didn t stand a chance and crushing the resistance was for the best He looked at the screen and typed in a few notes that he thought would prove useful in quelling the natives later Ideally the local population would fall in line as long as things were handled quickly and there wouldn t need to be unrest through North America It wasn t as if there were long odds against the marines on station and it would be better to keep the situation contained and away from the continent at large Not that partisans ever saw sense The useless buggers would try and spread though There was a home front advantage and the unrest will rise like the tide nae mistake about that He d seen it before and there was no doubt this would be the same It was a question of keeping things proportional You let things get out of hand and sentiment everywhere would shift across the planet At least there was no call for nuclear weapons not yet anyway and he jotted down a terse notation in his omni pad Allowing partisans to spread was how these scenarios spiraled out of control and before you knew it sentiment changed and relations were ruined Should that happen as distasteful as it was nuclear weapons might be an option Until then there was nae call for anything more overt A simple decisive decapitation strike would pacify the An alert chime sounded on his omni pad and Jama closed his notes and swiped open the alert Reading through the notice he paused in thought Home Fleet was back in the system Shil was rejoicing and the Palace had scheduled an announcement for PM Capitol time Jama spared a thought for what it all might mean The Empress would need time to make an announcement and she was a decent soul The return of the Home Fleet would bring a close to this sad chapter in everyone s lives Her Imperial Majesty would honor her daughter with a state funeral of course then life would go on Her Highness Princess Khelandri the once and future Empress would be sealed into a golden pod and sent to her final rest in Sham s embrace One with the sunlight she would shine down on Shil along with her ancestors sanctified in the embrace of the star itself And of course the period of mourning would be over Just as well that Alra da had reached out to ask him for an appraisal It offered a perfect excuse to show Tom a proper night out Trade at the Tide Pool will be brisk with everyone wanting a knees up It was quite a fair trade as Warrick s arrival had provided invaluable insights into pre collapse civilizations Who would have thought the lad would adapt so readily though He was proving to be a handful for young Miv but she was a sensible lass After all that had happened it was remarkable to find Tom was a good friend now he could return the favor by showing the lad a homeworld that was nae longer in mourning After setting an alarm to watch the announcement Jama set his pad down and reopened the other file He studied the report once more with a dour sense of the tragedy that would surely unfold So many lives sacrificed but it would be for the greater good Still treason s treason nae matter how ye shape it That was the thing about revolt that anyone from Sevastutav or Cambria could tell you There was no excuse Nothing that would mitigate the dishonor of a vassal rising against the lawful order There were no mitigating circumstances against rebellion against a sovereign Unless ye win Jama looked at the information and shook his head The marines would crush any resistance before it could spread There would be no revolt in Denver only a senseless waste of Human life Hold on to sixteen as long as you can Changes come around real soon make us women and men John Cougar Mellencamp s voice rolled through Tom s thoughts as the bus made its way through the Capitol and he considered the crowd around him in the privacy of his thoughts watching Melondi The city changed around them on their drive toward Miv eire s home The tall megascrapers that had worn muted colors during the time of mourning were lighting up again vibrant golds and purples and reds streaking up their sides illuminating the skyline as the news spread Melondi was somewhere around nineteen in Earth years but it wasn t the years it was the experience that made a difference He thought back to the young woman he d met before he d ever conceived she might be an Imperial Princess Melondi had the bloom of youth about her Not innocent and experimenting she was still more polished than people her age usually were Given her classmates that was saying something The girl had a certainty about her that didn t come easily A resolution to her character that truth be told reminded Tom of everything said about her mother the Empress In the beginning he d been a little in awe of his new circumstances and trying to adjust but his class had made an impression The girls were special every one of them but thankfully Human Studies had been a group of twelve Rather than the huge auditorium that was Marriage Fundamentals he d come to know his students as people There was plenty of give and take to Melondi She stood by her friends seemed to love Vedeem without reservation for his station and pursued life with a vigor undaunted by the weight on her shoulders Tom studied her as she whispered something to Vedeem and wondered what she was feeling now It was easier to ponder her feelings than to explore his own How many Humans had he seen since he d been on Shil Three and never together In fairness he hadn t been all that social before leaving Earth but this was different Now for the first time in months there were eight all experiencing Shil for the first time The two infants didn t count The young ones Cassandra and Joshua were holding on to their parents with all the certainty in the world that whatever was strange that Mom and Dad and Mom would make it safe He d known from Bherdin that Levi McClendon was married to his cousin s kho daughter That was part of how Human Food had gotten started though Bherdin sometimes got sketchy on the details It was nice to see the reality though Levi and his wives and the way Joshua was hanging on to Rhe something Rhe ella One more thing to remember besides not saying Mel when those two are in the same room Melody and Melondi Humans and Shil vati Levi s younger brother Eli looked out the window now and then while talking to his sister Hannah and tried not to look too impressed Hannah didn t share his reservations Sitting in the row behind Melondi she d been asked questions as they drove through the city and seemed to be having a good time Despite everything that must be on her mind Melondi had answered every question thoughtfully at least when Hannah s brother s wife s kho mother wasn t taking over the conversation Thry sis looked like she was in her element and enjoying every minute of it Not that Tom could blame her The D saari clan seemed to be made up of its Matriarch Thry sis along with her kho wives Akita Nyxie and Miara The three of them were watching over their husband Brelak who was deep in a quiet yet animated conversation with Bherdin As for Thry sis she seemed to thrive on doing something all the time and watching her supervise the bus had been interesting Thankfully Ce lani seemed to be getting on with Miara and weathered it all with good grace Rhe alla that was it was sitting with Levi while the other D saari s looked outside as the vast spaceport fell away and the Capital slowly surrounded them Solanna and Trik sis were looking outside with an easy manner while the youngest girl Yumi sighed and watched over their younger brother a boy named Lar gos The kicker was the older boy Jacarin He was around Vedeem s age Hell of a thing seeing a Shil vati guy wearing a flannel shirt and faded blue jeans like a second skin I thought Bherdin was going to faint As for the oldest McClendons it was hard to tell He d traded a few cautious words with Zachariah and his wife who d told him to call her Jenn moments before Thry sis began herding them all out of the terminal Despite feeling hustled he actually felt some envy toward the Shil vati matriarch I tried to wrap up Earth like a present for Miv How would I feel taking her back along with Lea Ce lani Desi Lea s mothers and maybe half my class Jax would be glued to the window and Lark would be taking pictures of everything Desi would be filing everything away she saw to ask me later while Dihsala would be trying to play it cool Lea s mothers would probably be asking me about nude beaches I can t exactly blame the woman for being proud and wanting to share it all The youngest have probably never left Earth Mind you it d been hard not to laugh when they d driven through the government center Just think children The Empress is back Thry sis exclaimed as they passed the Assembly of Noble Houses We may even see an appearance by one of the Royal Family Tom bit his lip and watched Melondi whose smile became a bit glazed He could laugh himself sick later on Besides they d arrived Prelitauri was a nice district Off in its commercial area Human Food was one of many upmarket quirky shops that catered to clients from all over the quarter Huddled along the coast it was one of those towns that was wealthy without being rich Affluent yes but it was a Petoskey rather than a Cape Cod Picturesque the houses dotting the coast were lovely without being the super mansions of the Shil vati elite and despite all the difficulties to what was left of House Pel avon Miv s home with Sholea had been the one thing she d fought to hold on to Now after inheriting a substantial sum the cottage was back to its full glory Why Bherdin this is just lovely Thry sis exclaimed But I d thought we were dropping off the children first We are dear Mister Warrick and his wives have been kind enough to lend us his home for the duration of your stay Two seats ahead Bherdin didn t quite inflate but he still looked pleased in profile That way dear Brelak will have a room to himself with one set aside for the McClendon s one for Nixie and Miara and another for you and Akitai His fiancee Miss Ce lani is staying with them for her recovery he added a bit tartly Tom watched the woman flounder for a moment but she recovered a lot faster than he d expected Ce lani managed to look more flustered at being called his fiancee than being labeled a disabled veteran but for all her bluster her thanks seemed genuine Not that she wasn t off and supervising the kids unloading the bags moments later Zachariah caught Tom s eye with a look and arched a questioning eyebrow while his wife gave him a warm but thoughtful smile Tom smiled back at the pair of them and gave a little it s all fine shrug of his shoulders and it was as long as the kids didn t destroy the place As his source for coffee and ham he owed them much Hot damn a place on the beach Eli mussed Hannah s hair on his way to the door forgetting to look bored for a moment This is gonna be great Levi the older brother was up and gave Tom a quiet nod At his side Melody wore a demure smile while Rhe alla was beaming the trio busy organizing their children in the way parents always were It wouldn t do to barge in but Miv might want to meet them She d always wanted children in the house No this will be alright Well I can hardly wait to see where we re staying cousin Akita and I will be wonderful bunkmates Thry sis offered crisply I m sure it will be so wonderfully cozy Tom watched as Bherdin turned to the window with a dismissive Fttt God damn I swear I can see his blood pressure rising from here The only public compartment on the ship with real space was the gym Liam stretched out fully under the watchful gaze of Belda and Pris It had taken some coaxing to get the story out of Pris about what had put her into such a funk but when she d told them both Well he d never really seen Bel pissed off before and truth be told he was a little irate himself But Bel She d spent a good twenty minutes using language he d never heard from her Some of it wasn t even in Vatikre but Liam was pretty sure he got the gist just fine Getting them all out of the stateroom had been a good idea It had been two days together and he needed the room A trip off Shil with his well Bel was his girl and he wanted to marry her but two days into the trip and she already wanted him to have a girlfriend What the hell would he tell Hope when he got back That was the neat thing about Shil vati women they didn t fool around Pris and Bel were friends from pretty different worlds but they both wore their hearts on their sleeves Pris had more filters than Bel after listening to her cuss for fifteen minutes he was pretty sure she had a lot more but that was nice too You knew exactly where you stood Growing up on Earth with Tyler there hadn t been a lot of that Not that he hadn t understood Maybe not at first but eventually he d caught on Hope hadn t had any more choice about leaving than he d had about staying Not that it made staying with Tyler any easier He d always been stuck in the past worrying on one hand or judging him on the other He d done the best he d known how but it hadn t been easy for either of them Tyler had gone ballistic at his choice to go live with Hope and things had gotten ugly fast In the end he hadn t been able to get out of there fast enough It was easy to feel comfortable with Bel and as it turned out it was just as easy to be around Pris He didn t find himself worrying about them saying one thing and thinking something else It was kind of like dealing with a Marine back home but in a nice way Sure you knew what was on their mind and maybe it was because he d settled so easily into the boyfriend zone with Bel but Pris wasn t making it weird She was expectant sure but it was like they were a pod of two He didn t feel like he was being fought over or judged That was pretty chill Coming to Shil had been a real change He d steered clear of Hope s students but everywhere he d run into Shil vati or the Rakiri at the club they d been no worse than people back home Okay the fight in the bar had been less than great but again not so bad Belda had his back and not just a little bit She was there all in all the way And Pris Well Pris gave him the same vibe He looked at the pair as they chatted together watching him while he limbered up And yeah it s confusing but face it they d never abandon you And if they were confusing it wasn t because they were messing with your head It was just easy to be with people who didn t always have their guard up It had taken him a lot of growing up to get past Tyler mostly thanks to his friends They d always been pretty easy and Tyler really hadn t It seemed like the older generation always felt the need to protect themselves It was like that for a lot of people after the Shil vati came but always keeping your guard up wasn t any way to live It was kind of why he d never been comfortable with Human girls There always seemed to be some hidden agenda Maybe Tyler was right about some of it but he always took things way too far There was a point when you went from being careful to being so hurt that you stopped letting anyone in That wasn t what he wanted Tyler had always tried to be in control It was all a lie and he d been a miserable bastard whenever he ran into something he couldn t The older Liam had gotten the more that something had been him Bel and Pris weren t afraid of being open of being vulnerable Sure Pris had literally tried to hide herself away but she d opened up just as fast when they talked Bel was probably right to push me out of the cabin to find her too In their own ways both of them showed they liked him and neither of them had been afraid to ask for help They d shown they trusted him Bel had already clearly invested herself in him and once he d said yes she d doubled down He didn t feel strangled it was just like there was no bullshit about it and it felt like Pris wanted the same thing Pris was a lot more exuberant than Bel or at least blushed less She didn t have any social anxiety After his talk with her it was pretty clear she really didn t care what other people thought She d cared a lot about what he thought That was pretty chill too The more he saw of her the more he saw why she and Bel were such good friends Show some people a door and they d wonder if you were going to shut it in their faces Bel walked right through but she also held it open for Pris Anyway it had gotten him out of their stateroom With nothing much to do besides watch videos he d badly wanted the exercise and it turned out Pris didn t know how to dance Well that wouldn t fly but instead of the battle he expected in offering to teach her she d jumped at the chance Of course his kind of dancing needed room and there was the gym He almost finished stretching when a whistle came from the corridor It was Halra the crew woman that had been giving Pris such a load of shit Looking good there Halca was leaning in the doorway and licked her tongue across her lips suggestively Got room for one more handsome No I really don t The words were on his lips and he d meant to say them It was just that Belda got there first Listen up tits for brains you can get your miserable skanky ass out of here and shove it back in the tail end of this barge with the rest of the crap Bel growled as she crossed the room raising her fist You even think about laying a hand on Liam and I swear to the Goddess that Bel You re a lady Pris pursed her lips and sighed laying a hand on Bel s fist Remember your ABCs Always be clear Always be classy Always be concise But she I mean it The ABCs are for everyone Clear classy and concise Pris looked from Bel to the engineer and her voice became colder than space Fuck off bitch Tom Steinberg sat in his man cave working on a pet project of his Well everyone called it the office but it was a man cave damnit The work wasn t anything particularly malicious just some blackmail should he run across members of the Nobility he particularly disliked In this case though it was a little more close to home There were a couple lunatics he paid to go obtain information from sources and currently he was looking in on the head of the Shil equivalent of the Home Owners Association of Prelitauri of which his neighborhood was one part It wasn t Tom s business to ask whether the lunatics hung the HOA s people over the side of buildings or tickled them with a feather till they promised to behave but HOA s just pissed him off After the last few times they d charged him for really stupid shit he d decided it was war Oftentimes just gathering information to gather more information required blackmail all its own And thus Tom was currently watching some footage of the HOA President specifically what she d done with a hooker he d hired just for this purpose Mind you she d paid for the hooker with appropriated HOA funds She deserved what she got And as for what she d done to earn his ire well she hadn t exactly badmouthed survivors of the Liberation or legislated in favor of male trafficking but well she just had the most punchable face on the HOA and Tom intensely disliked her When you were a spy you were allowed to do that Playing politics was a fun hobby Lucrative too Anyways Tom sipped his bloodwine not the Pesrin stuff that would melt your insides chuckling at the lewd display in front of him Got you he grumbled watching the depravity at the villa on Palm Miandoir Tom If Tom s desk hadn t been facing the door he would have been in deep shit and having to explain that no he wasn t watching porn this was work stuff Yeah what s up There stood Avee radiant as ever especially with the baby on the way Behind her was a Pesrin Can I help you he asked Tom wasn t averse to Pesrin his experiences generally left him quite fond of them Still one of the furry nopes standing in your office was never a good sign Hi the girl said brightly I m Rhykishi of the Natahss ja Remember me Ummm yah Rhykishi of the Natahss ja Sure Tom answered wearily She still hadn t explained what she was doing here Did you need something he added She just knocked on the door Avee confessed Ok that was odd If a Pesrin wanted something they didn t usually bother with politeness As a species the Pesrin were more kick the door down and take it types Yeah We met the other night You drove my sister home Without a word Rhykishi slid behind Tom s desk and peered at his work She must ve pegged what he was doing because she gave him a quick nice before hopping down into the other chair So you know she needs to get her shit together A quick kick in the thorps Something was moving under Tom s desk It was Shanky so Tom picked up the rhinel and held him on his lap absentmindedly tapping out a tune on his head Well Rhykishi looked concerned We ve done all the kicking we can It didn t work so we figured she needs a Hahackt instead Tom s Pesrin was still spotty in parts so he gave it his best guess A mentor Uh huh Rhykishi nodded brightly swinging her feet beneath her She s a great scout but she needs someone to teach her how to get her shit together Great Want me to find you one I can put the word out No no Rhykishi put a hand up We selected you Oh I see Tom s mind raced His life had just gotten a lot more complicated But he knew Pesrin He didn t really have a way to say no He sat there staring into space as Shanky nibbled on his fingers That s a helluva honor Um let me talk to my wife Sure thing Rhykishi hopped up swinging her asiak in an amused way as she looked around the room By the way you gonna eat that Rhinel Yah Shanky yelled indignantly While the Rhinel held Tom s attention the vid he d been watching was overridden by a news alert Tom took a quick look at the bulletin and nearly had a heart attack The Home Fleet was returning His mind swam with new work opportunities Horny sailors always had some skeletons in the closet especially officers The Palace is pleased to announce word from Space Traffic Control heralding the return of significant elements of Home Fleet Our beloved Empress is committed to preserving our sovereignty and remains away on deployment along the Alliance Border For now Princess Kamaud re and her son Prince Lu ral have returned in her stead bringing her best wishes for a bountiful Eth rovi This momentous occasion marks a significant event in our Imperium s history The return of Home Fleet symbolizes her dedication to safeguarding our interests and maintaining peace and security In the Empress absence a grand reception and ceremonial events are planned to welcome the Princess Kamaud re home comprehensive information can be found on the data link attached We encourage all citizens to join in celebrating this moment of national pride and unity Even as we do the Palace also asks that Prince Lu ral and his wife be granted the peace and isolation they need in their time of grief During this celebration let us come together as one Empire demonstrating our unwavering support Our thoughts go out to Her Imperial Majesty as she carries out her Jama switched off the announcement and scowled at the monitor There was never anything worth watching on the thing that was nae outdone by a good novel but the news was the news and he flipped through the information on the data link And what news that was Only half of Home Fleet was back in the system Half Certainly it was a relief to countless families during the holiday as husbands and sons welcomed back their loved ones but the other half was being deployed by the Empress hand and would nae be home any time soon Oh aye the Empress returned her daughter and son along with a fair bit of the court to help celebrate Eth rovi The time of mourning was past but what time were they entering now Jama pursed his lips as he pondered the report reading between the lines The Empress had found her daughter s remains at least what would serve for symbolic burial and that would happen when she returned but that time was not now Her Majesty had set the fleet on the grim task of scouring the area of debris spread across the system to leave no daughter behind and the fleet had brought them home Her Majesty would nae return home with her child leaving others to mourn empty handed It was nae her style And having done that If you cut through all the conciliatory turox shit Kamilesh was deploying Home Fleet along the Alliance border to wipe every pirate privateer and unregistered military asset out of her sky The woman s blood up and by the goddess she d make the stars bleed That was very much her style Sending back the Court had been a kind gesture though it would have consequences Princess Kamaud re was back The useless tit was probably planning a party and while tha had its time and place during Eth rovi the lass s habits had little to do with affairs of state Kamaud re wanted to be loved or at least a measure of public adoration but the sad truth was there was little about her that was lovable She observed the proper forms duty required but there was a streak of narcissism about her that showed around the edges An indolence that seemed to put self beside service and possibly before it As for Prince Lu ral He d always been comfortable providing his mother support but he d removed himself from the spotlight of public life to raise a family Only the death of his sister had taken him from them and he d returned to the worst news any father could imagine There would be no Eth rovi for the lad No welcome home from Lady Orelea No loving embrace from his youngest daughter Lu ral would only have learned of their deaths when the fleet returned and surely all of Shil would weep with him Love and loss Triumph and tragedy Redemption and revenge It would be a bittersweet Eth rovi and Jama wondered what it all might mean for Princess Khelira The lass was probably wandering the halls of the Palace Not yet out in the public she d be trapped by custom and circumstance though Ganya probably knew more He d wager the lass was studying at the Academy though with the holiday break she d be alone Ah well so much for the news It was nae his affair Jama re opened his game of Civilization and reviewed his forces His Spanish had marched up from South America re taken Mexico and demolished the American menace Marines had crushed the partisans around Denver and secured his final hold on the continent The war had nae been popular with the other AI forces but with the American AI subdued the only real contender left was the Chinese Soon he d rule all of Earth with a military victory though a cultural win was always preferable It really was ironic For all that Tom insisted that Humans wanted peace they had an innate talent for war Even this game he d borrowed from Tom was proof enough Humans dreamed of Imperium as long as it was on terms they enjoyed It was clear Warrick had been loath to lend the game over The lad tried to show the best of his world and it troubled him greatly when inconvenient truths reared their head The only real shame was the lad missed the truth one day at a time it was Tom himself as was showing the best of Humanity People lose themselves in crowds and congregations Ach well I ll take him out for a dinner he will nae forget It would be a good Eth rovi at least for most"

        "cleaned_text": "The debate starts off with Mr Cathcart Wason pointing out that gt Question after Question had been asked with regard to continual abuses of the law and the necessity for fresh regulations had been urged but they had been met with indifference The question was of great importance to the whole country In many places in Scotland for instance the children of the poor had been accustomed to play in the streets from time immemorial having no other playground At the time of the debate cars were still outnumbered on the roads It s approximated that during the death of Bridget Driscoll in the first recorded person killed by an automotive collision in Great Britain there were motor vehicles By this number had jumped to The debate which took place seven years after the first recorded death reflects the growing concerns and agitation of the public at the prospect of sharing the road which up until that point were seen as common property but were at the risk of being monopolized by motor vehicles while driving off people children bicycles and other forms of transportation It s important to note that at the time of the debate cars were still the luxury of aristocrats and the rich but the roads were being increasingly given away to a small number of people Wason continued gt The present position was that a few people claimed the right to build cars of enormous weight and speed and to monopolise the public roads for the running of those cars They claimed the right to drive the public off the roads Harmless men women and children dogs and cattle had all got to fly for their lives at the bidding of one of these slaughtering stinking engines of iniquity He continued that he had no problem that these persons sought to amuse themselves and to gratify a satiated and vitiated palate by trying to come into as close contact with death as possible but he most bitterly protested that they should seek to gratify their taste at the expense of the general public If these people wished to race he continued they should build tracks for themselves and not use the public roads for that purpose The public perception of motor vehicles at the time was extremely negative most considered drivers road hogs and it would not be until decades later with the help of lobbying of the automotive industry and the rise of this or that driving organizations pressuring local governments that the destruction of the road as a public space would be complete Wason was joined in by Mr George Harwood who said gt This was not a matter of motorists and non motorists It was a question of the common right of citizens A man could not take his family for a walk along the roads within a distance of thirty or forty miles of London with either comfort or safety The danger was a very real one but quite apart from the danger the inconvenience arising from the existing state of things was extremely great This thing must be stopped It was not a matter of wild shrieking but it must be remembered that after all a motor was the luxury of a few who could take their pleasures in many other ways To people in poorer circumstances the avenues of pleasure were limited He went one step further to demand that cars must be identified by a number so that the police may properly identify violators of the law and that perhaps the Government could do with motor cars as was done with certain other conveyances viz restrict them to travelling between the hours of six o clock in the evening and six o clock in the morning They were countered by Mr Scott Montagu who condemned reckless driving but asked the committee not to be carried away by what he admitted was the strong feeling of the public at present against motoring in general He conceded that identification is a fine proposal but that the present hard and fast limit of twelve miles an hour in town and country alike was ridiculous He hoped for a bill that would gt provide for identification and would at the same time remove the twelve miles an hour speed limit That limit led to reckless driving because when a motorist could break the law by travelling fourteen miles an hour he thought he might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb and went at a far higher speed What would happen when the reckless drivers applied the same logic to a higher speed limit was not questioned Mr Scott Montagu went on to become a prominent promoter of motor vehicles the founder and editor for The Car Illustrated His son went on to found the National Motor Museum in his honor Sir H Meysey Thompson then spoke with some extraordinary clairvoyance predicting what were to happen to most major cities by the mid s He first said that he did not think identification was all that necessary because the danger was much more serious He said gt Cars were being built which could easily be run at the rate of sixty miles an hour if motor cars were allowed to be driven at anything like that rate they must have a monopoly of the road Was there to be no restraint on chauffeurs who went thirty fifty or even sixty miles an hour except the fear of penalty if they did any actual damage They would very likely do no damage because if these speeds were allowed no one else would dare to use the road except in fear and trembling and everything would have to get out of their way Did the public wish that the roads should be given up entirely to motors or did they wish that motors were to be allowed to take their place among the ordinary traffic on the condition that they were not driven at rates of speed which must inevitably interfere with the ordinary use of the road by ordinary people Sir Thomas Nussey added gt To my mind it is perfectly clear that there is a very great and inherent difference between the rights of the two parties because the public has the use of the road by common law whereas the motorists have only the right by statute The public have a birthright to use the road The public have a right to come and say These roads are ours and we have a right to use them and you must not pass any legislation which conflicts with our interests Sir Frederick Banbury added that he believed this issue to be a growing evil and said that he did not object to motor cars because they belonged to rich people gt The real question was that the roads of England were made for the people and they should not be monopolised by a certain section no matter whether they belonged to the poor or the rich A few months later in August of the speed limit was raised to mph and in the speed limit was removed entirely in UK roads because as one MP put it two years later not that anybody thought the abolition would tend to the greater security of foot passengers but that the existing speed limit was so universally disobeyed that its maintenance brought the law into contempt directly contradicting Montagu s reasoning for increasing the limit from mph The speed limit would go through various revisions over the years especially during WWII but what was predicted during the debate about motor cars driving people off the roads and monopolizing what was once a common public space was already viciously accomplished the roads completely devoured by the mid s Further readings The Speed Of Motor Cars Volume debated on Thursday June https hansard parliament uk Commons debates cf f ef ab a b ee

amp ws nb guide amp dl will help you spot and check for these type of shortcomings The seller has a notification obligation The seller has the obligation to mention any information which can be important to you as a buyer This obligation requires the seller to tell you any shortcomings the house might have Do note that it can be the case that a seller is not aware of any invisible

        "cleaned_text": "Hey Reddit I ve got a story to tell One filled with broken promises unprofessional conduct and a serious case of buyer s remorse I m sharing this so you can avoid falling into a similar trap to the same costly mistake I did with Roi Levi s photography workshop weeks ago I joined a workshop run by Roi Levi https www instagram com astroi levi hl en and it was nothing short of a nightmare Not only was most of the itinerary a lie he outright deceived me under false pretenses with me only realizing once I was alone and too afraid to confront him because I was outnumbered in a foreign country I am now safe in my own country Hong Kong and having given up on any sort of recourse I can only hope that my experience can be a reminder for others on how to avoid this kind of mishap and not waste our hard earned money and valuable time Even now he continues to publicly lie https imgur com a pgM T about the events that happened trying to lure any unsuspecting customers willing to trust him For some context I am an avid traveler with a passion for landscape photography Since I have joined more than photography workshops in various countries both in private and group sessions and have always enjoyed and benefited from them I discovered Roi Levi on his Facebook https www facebook com RoiLeviPhotography where he was offering a day astrophotography workshop in Iceland His profile seemed legitimate with a good amount of Instagram followers and some Israeli media covering his work https www israel c org astrophotographs that are literally out of this world I have always wanted to learn more about astrophotography and its editing and my initial conversations with Roi showed that he was passionate about his work and seemed professional enough for me to commit The chance to enhance my skills with a talented photographer in a country as beautiful as Iceland seemed like a once in a lifetime opportunity In hindsight there were definite signs I should have noticed which leads me to my first lesson Stay alert for minor red flags For me this included Roi claims he s led many workshops in the US but surprisingly no such testimonials exist I initially couldn t join Roi s group workshop due to a date clash with a prior workshop Roi proceeded to change his entire proposed schedule for me something extremely irregular since other workshops would not rearrange accommodation and transport for a single participant After paying a deposit of he asked me to pay more https imgur com dBdgI t and that he would refund me afterwards When I said that I wanted to call off this workshop he then backpedaled and said everything was fine https imgur com a snL B After paying the deposit I received no emails of a suggested packing list accommodation info or anything relating to the workshop until I prompted him https imgur com a t iobrb for it I was stupid enough to ignore these signs partially due to Roi constantly reassuring me that everything was fine and that he had a mountain of experience doing guided tours However I had also made it clear to Roi that my participation was contingent on having a private room that the group was staying in due to privacy concerns He obliged with a quote of night https imgur com a mCFpKhA As time passed and the date of the workshop grew closer I began to worry There hadn t been any new information no group chat with all the attending members and no confirmation of accommodation I expressed my concerns and reminded him again of the single room before he replied with the price going from to https i imgur com iy fgKL jpg to https i imgur com ynV ydT jpg This was my second lesson Confirm all costs upfront and hidden before you commit At this point it was five days to the workshop start date th and I found it both too late and disrespectful to cancel on Roi Levi so I paid the extra thinking that I could at least get a hotel room by myself as I m uncomfortable sharing my space with strangers It would be a stretch to say I was extorted but I was definitely made to feel guilty if I had refused In parallel inconsistent information about the number of participants added to my anxiety It struck me as odd All workshops I ve been a part of had a clear roster and an active group chat NOT having the participation numbers fluctuate on a whim https imgur com a tU KG E With all these inconsistencies piling up I felt increasingly uneasy but held onto the hope that maybe Roi s organization skills would be better in person There were still people in the group chat after all This optimism as I was about to discover was misplaced This leads me to my third lesson Ensure participation numbers are clear and a group chat is set up early on It was only on the first day of the workshop that I made a startling realization I was the ONLY paying participant Aside from me and Roi there were only other participants both of whom had a prior affiliation with each other this was Roi s older brother who came as a driver and Roi s business partner Jay Despite saying that there would be two guides https imgur com a erJPguh both Roi s brother and Jay had never been to Iceland before All this and the workshop just started it was too late to turn back now but I made sure to document every inconsistency and lie between Roi Levi s itinerary and what actually happened in the link here https drive google com file d MEBJJ IsLCxBUYAo GeSxdhrRr BpPwX view usp sharing In the interest of your time and sanity here s a summary of the worst parts Misrepresenting Accommodation That private hotel room I paid for Turns out they were all makeshift Airbnbs Roi would simply empty out a room and say that was mine We still had to all share a single bathroom and Roi remarked that I should be grateful False Itinerary The entire plan was more fiction than actual fact Many activities were either skipped entirely or poorly managed From ice cave tours that never happened to the chaos of misdirected shoots the entire schedule was unreliable Chronic Lateness Roi and his team were always behind schedule Whether it was waiting an hour for them to get ready or staying longer than expected for Roi to get his personal Instagram shots they never respected the timetable Poor Transportation Every day was a game of find the destination Even with Google Maps they d constantly get lost for hours Lack of Professionalism Verbal arguments incessant chatter about irrelevant topics and constant scavenging for basics like batteries and gloves made the trip feel more like a chaos filled road trip than a professional workshop Dangerous Behavior They even drank and drove https imgur com ibtpahc Considering how challenging Icelandic roads can be this was not just unprofessional but downright dangerous Sleep Deprivation The combination of these factors made proper sleep a luxury It wasn t the late night shoots but their personal adventures and detours that kept me awake For instance on a day when we were supposed to be back by am detours and distractions saw us searching for our Airbnb at am with a flight looming in just a couple of hours Through all this It became painfully obvious that I was sponsoring their vacation in Iceland Worst of all the very essence of the workshop the allure that drew me in capturing the Milky Way was entirely ignored Not once did Roi Levi attempt to capture it let alone guide me He boasted about his star tracker yet I never saw it in action He brought up teaching me drone photography but only took it out once for minutes panicked about losing it after it took off then put it away for the rest of the trip Whenever we arrived at a location Roi Levi would prioritize his angle first and force me to use whatever angle he deemed fit I enrolled in this workshop to learn and evolve not to mimic another photographer With the workshop concluded I do not feel that I have learned anything new nor have I gained anything from this experience Per Roi s itinerary he committed to teaching me his editing techniques during the workshop This never materialized When approached about it he promised to assist me online Yet even now he constantly emphasizes how I should be grateful https i imgur com mRlFJeO jpg and sets a condition that I credit him for each image in exchange for his editing guidance https i imgur com J BSVO jpg Should I be thankful for this workshop Do I need to credit him for every picture posted TL DR Joined Roi Levi s Iceland photography workshop expecting professional guidance but faced a series of red flags broken promises unprofessional behavior and outright deception Ended up inadvertently sponsoring their vacation receiving no proper training and now battling over photo credits Beware and always research thoroughly before committing to overseas workshops"

masterpost about why it s almost always a bad idea Three reasons not to collect artifacts Disrespect and desecration This is always the point that should come first Indigenous Americans still exist and they are not remnants of an extinct race Artifacts including things like arrowheads projectile points and potsherds are proof of their continued existence on this continent for the past years and they are sacred and should be treated with respect That means not using them in tacky decorations https rockseeker com wp content uploads native american Indian arrowhead collection jpg or stockpiling them in boxes Or advertising your hobby with cringey merchandise https www amazon com Collection Ancient Native American Artifacts dp B BSRD X Native American material culture has been fetishized and sold for centuries now from cigar store Indians https en wikipedia org wiki Cigar store Indian to kitschy costumes https www pnj com story news local pensacola beaches fictitious pensacola mayoki indians spark outrage social media to fake Native souvenir shops https www theartnewspaper com alaska store lawsuit fake indigenous artefacts Native Americans aren t stock characters or mythical beings Destroying the archaeological record Despite what many people think archaeology isn t necessarily about digging artifacts out of the ground in general we do our best to keep them in the ground as much as possible The context of an artifact is far more important than the artifact itself and every bit of data that can be recorded is recorded An artifact without context like an arrowhead dug out of the ground tells us very little Archaeology is a destructive science in that excavation destroys information in such a way that it can never be recovered so digging and sifting even on your own private land is a bad idea You might think that what you re doing is no worse than what archaeologists are doing in the field but you re actively destroying cultural resources for personal gain As anthropologist Krystiana Krupa puts it collection is not curation https blogs iu edu sciu collection is not curation Searching for artifacts to keep as personal property AKA loot is called looting even if it s ostensibly legal Encouraging others to destroy the archaeological record You might be saying to yourself hey I m a good amateur archaeologist I don t ever dig or sift I only do surface finds And that might be true an arrowhead found in a tilled field is unlikely to warrant any groundbreaking research But even then collecting smokers and building collections ends up glorifying the hobby and building economic interest in the antiquities trade Myths and misconceptions Arrowheads or potsherds etc are so common that they don t have any archaeological value Despite popular notions of what we do the vast majority of archaeology is concerned with boring stuff the minutia of ancient life Not just the billions of projectile points and pieces of shattered pottery but also debitage discarded mollusk shells charred animal bones petrified human waste https en wikipedia org wiki Lloyds Bank coprolite and plenty of other stuff that s not very glamorous Once again context is always more important than the actual artifact itself As an example occasionally we find caches of raw obsidian in the Central Valley of California These are undoubtedly anthropogenic human caused because obsidian does not naturally form in this area Most people even collectors wouldn t bat an eye at most of these since they aren t even worked just buried jumbles of volcanic glass But it is interesting to archaeologists that for some reason traders from the eastern slope of the Sierras preferred to transport obsidian in large unmodified chunks rather than more workable spalls or even trade blanks Modern Native Americans aren t related to the people who made this or that artifact it s too old Native Americans show an incredible amount of genetic continuity with their geographic precursors In fact humans in general show an incredible amount of genetic continuity with geographic precursors even when taking into account migration and linguistic shifts The Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation finally proved that they were the closest living relatives of the Kennewick Man https en wikipedia org wiki Kennewick Man who lived nine thousand years ago and whose body was found on their territory This was after years of heated debate from archaeologists about whether or not to take their oral histories seriously when deciding whether or not to return the body to them In short the descendants of whoever made that point you re holding are probably your neighbors I m preserving history by collecting points You re more likely doing more harm than good Even ignoring the risk to the archaeological record the idea that history is private property that even can be collected is damaging If it belongs to anyone other than the public at large it belongs to the descendants of the people who made it If you think an archaeological site or a cultural resource is in danger get in touch with an archaeologist instead of trying to excavate it yourself These arrowheads potsherds etc are way too common to be sacred no one would really care This is again a very popular idea that bigger is better and that the little things don t matter much Maybe a beautiful eccentric flint or a carved soapstone effigy would be disrespectful to own but this little point is just some ancient trash For the Yokuts of Central California can you guess my specialty area all obsidian kots is sacred tripne spiritually powerful Larry Kooper of the Standing Bear Council of Keokuk https www thetelegraph com news article Artifacts tell Native Americans stories php puts it this way gt I get a lot of calls and people come to my house and ask me to identify arrowheads or a tomahawk I will not touch them We believe that an artifact still has the spirit of the person who had it Also note how this article which only mentions Cooper as an aside talks about Native Americans It s the artifacts specifically those in the possession of a white collector that apparently tells the story It isn t the elder who is literally explaining the cultural and spiritual value of those things How is this any less ethical than digging up burials or whatever archaeologists do Anthropologists love to shit on our predecessors and for good reason We re constantly talking about turns in our discipline to move away from this or that and trying to reconcile with our past how our discipline is rooted in race science and grave robbing So we ll probably be the second to tell you yeah digging up burials is fucked These days we specifically try not to do that And when we have to usually in the context of salvage archaeology when a burial site is going to be destroyed by development it should be done under the supervision of descendant communities Or even better be done by those descendant communities In the words of anthropologist Angelo Baca Hopi Din https www scientificamerican com article anthropology association apologizes to native americans for the fields legacy of harm gt T he time for Indian experts is over Now is the time for expert Indians After you know the relatives of the people who are getting dug up I m an archaeologist too No I m th Cherokee Unlikely https slate com news

toll isn t The societal cost of depression and anxiety is over BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR just in absenteeism reduced productivity and several other non treatment related costs Same w SUDS We are treating

clinicians asserting that they re wildly underpaid and people insisting there s an easy fix for that the underpaid person just needs to try harder In this way the thread reflects a core ideological phenomenon in society at large Whenever they re presented with the fact that capitalism inevitably creates victims and that not everyone can fight it and win people who aren t in that position fervently and sometimes angrily insist that the poor person is responsible for their poverty That reflex is the result of a largely subconscious defense mechanism called moral exculpation which allows the person with economic privilege to disavowal the unfairness of a system that happens to have benefited them while harming others as well as a basic form of denial to keep at bay the uncomfortable truth that none of us are really free we don t actually have nearly as much agency as we would prefer to I added this edit because it s relevant to clinical work Many of the people we serve have been deeply harmed by the myth of meritocracy and many have even internalized it blaming themselves for their low SES Class mobility in America is the lowest of any industrialized nation on earth Systemic oppression is real I m glad I might have a chance to earn a living wage if I can survive three more years of poverty working toward the LPCC S designation but not everyone can get out of poverty

        "cleaned_text": "just got back from Japan We flew to Tokyo but immediately took bullet train to Kyoto to stay a few days before taking train back to Kyoto to stay a few more days and these are my notes from it Also a little bit about me so to see where my thoughts come from I am from Oklahoma I have been to Ireland Mexico and a few Central American Countries When I travel I enjoy people watching just seeing how they act in their day to day life more so than tourist stuff Without further ado be warned this is long The air is so much cleaner than in Oklahoma I don t have a problem breathing here but in Japan you can feel the difference Kyoto is better than Tokyo in this regard but still better than Tulsa They do a lot biking especially in Kyoto They have very much an infrastructure that allows for it and walking compared to Oklahoma FYI I didn t bike but our AirBNB host lent us bikes but warned us to make sure we do park our bikes in designated parking spots or it could be towed so be warned Speaking of walking I am not hundred percent sure what side of the sidewalk to walk on I think left but i saw many people ve on right This is for my bigger both in width and heighth fellow travelers Japan is not exactly built for you Kyoto more than Tokyo I am lbs pounds I traveled with people feet There were several places they had to be careful to walk or they would hit their head wheras i was perfect height And then in terms of width a lot of restaurants walkways etc are very cramped They don t have a wide open walkway like we in American so accessibility nay be an issue if bigger than that our AirBNB restroom could not hold someone or above Restaurant hours in Japan are a bit different They don t have a lot of diners that open before especially Kyoto The only place I found that was with walking distance open at am was a breakfast chain i think its called Nakau Then several restaurants are open for like to or then close until So plan accordingly Speaking of food the good was amazing I only had one thing couldn t finish and it was grated frozen pickled yam Otherwise everything was great We did do Sushi converyor belt I am not big on American Sushi but this was amazing I also enjoy doing fast food in countries to see difference I got the spicy chicken sandwich from McD and Samurai burger I didn t care for either but could eat The chicken was spicy due to wasabi which I don t like and the burger had a weird soy teriyaki sauce didn t care for This is just a tip When we went the conversion rate was roughly yen so it may change Don t think of it was yen but think of it as yen So the conversion is So anything you see multiple by divide by and put a decimal ahead of last two digits IE yen is This is more for Kyoto than Tokyo but is so much more quiet than Tulsa Probably due to less cars but still This is just for Kyoto but we went to Kyoto thinking it was going to be that old school type of Japan And it is partially Where we were staying a cat sanctuary airbnb it looked not that dissimilar from any small city There were small areas like a few shrines that offset but overall typical city However if you go towards a monkey park it will be very much American stereotypical old school Japan Also the various s Anime like YuYu Hakusho and Sailormoon give a good representation of the architecture I couldn t find a sports drink like Gatorade or Powerade at any of the convenience stores Speaking of which is an abundance there Like it is extremely common there and surprisingly their hot food is really good for a late night snack Also they are vending machine culture Literally one every yards The sunrise was extremely early Like their am looked like Tulsa s am They have a robust public transportation system Between taxis subway bus and trolley you can easily get around So if you aren t great at walking long distances we did about miles a day you can find a way One thing people say is Japan is extremely clean and you don t see litter this is very true in Kyoto I saw no litter there ever With that said by clean they don t mean shiny and things looking straight This may not be best word but Kyoto does have a bit of run down quality to it You will see most things metal things rusted buildings will be faded or peeling their windows are full of mismatched signs very cluttered Tokyo is a bit different There definitely is litter though it may be from tourist more so than locals But everything has a nice shine to it and organized quality And even with litter the first thing in the morning you see are shop keeps sweeping it up Coming back to Kyoto even though run down it feels extremely safe even middle of the night Unlike Tulsa there was no fear of being robbed We saw no homeless people which was odd Also we didn t see bugs I recommend carrying something that you can put trash in we carried a backpack We didn t come across any trash cans really Surprising due to lack of litter So people in Japan are kind but not American friendly Like we were stopped and helped more than once prolly helps we had an attractive blonde However they aren t social in terms of randomly talking and they allnhave RBF Most of their traffic lights don t have a button they are automatic and most of them don t have the beeping for the blind Asahi beer cans had braille which was cool All of the toilets we used had Bidets which was cool However their TP sucks If I go again I will bring a roll They don t even have one play its like half ply Like I love a Bidet I have one at home but you still need a strongTP to hold up to moisture Coming back to food their food will satisfy you but won t make you full What I mean is you won t be hungry but unlike an American meal won t feel stuffed Smoking is a lot more common than the states Not all prices include the tax If you are using Google maps while walking and it tells you to take a turn and you don t see it look closely It is very Zelda like and it has hidden paths If you do try Tinder you will need to validate your age We couldn t get it to work while there My friend who is staying weeks got it to work eventually and said this I kept having it go to chrome instead of keeping it on the internet page it sent me to The other part it needed to see both pages and all corners of the passport They are extemely ruthless in an elevator Like they wait no time to close the elevator after people exit Like I got my arm hit because someone hit the button so fast They do not wait for someone to enter Coming back to walking these peopl give no fucks when it comes to walking in front of cars If they have the right of way they take it In Tulsa if you see a car coming even if you have right of way you wait to ensure These people are like nah I am going And if a car is waiting to turn you will hustle across Nope they leisurely stroll Also I know they are walk centric but really surprised by lack of gas stations Here we have them roughly every mile Them nope These are my observations for a week in Japan"

Dawn Creek and greater Province Date Standardized human time October rd A human stampede That is what Governor Tarva had called it A stampede of humans reacting in fear and anger from the pain of losing so many This bomb was just that an act of anger and despair like that of a creature trapped in a cage Not an attack not a raid just an act of despair And so I huffed speaking into my data pad to Kevros if you do not pull back all your exterminators from that Facility within the quarter claw I will consider this treasonous insurrection and enact Code Zero It was harsh possibly too harsh but this was the end of my rope The Exterminators besieged the facility preparing an assault on the VENLIL workers The protests almost immediately reignited around our building There was so much confusion and fear it was almost too much I had to send out a Magisterial order for all transit tubes in the province to be temporarily suspended so the protests did not hit a critical mass and turn into a mass mad stampede Sir I heard Kevros argue we saw a threat Our Governor is incapacitated We need to Governor Tarva is in stable condition in the Xenomedical Grand Complex She has given the order that no exterminators are to attack any human or refugee site in retaliation Now are you going to comply or do I need to make the call The speaker was silent for only a moment We will be gone in a quarter claw I fell back into my chair as he disconnected Finally after skipping my sleep claw to deal with this disaster one of the most important tasks was done By Solgalick I need something to get me through all this I rubbed the sides of my head and my eyes fell to a drawer by my desk Arvi had visited me a few paws ago and gave me these small bottles that claimed they would give energy for over a claw The one I drank showed that to be no lie It pushed me through all the paperwork But it made me jittery like my heart wanted to hammer out of my chest And if that was just one bottle I have no idea how he was able to drink so much and still be alive I know it was not a pleasant experience to come down from But still I found one of the two extra bottles within my hand Enough energy to get through the rest of this paw after not getting any sleep It was tempting Too tempting I need that little boost for this emergency I cracked open the top and raised the liquid to my lips downing the caffeinated contents in one gulp A soft ring from my door caught my ears Your Honor Prestige Officer Valho is here to see you I felt some relief wash through me I remembered Valho as the only competent exterminator during the transport of the Gojid refugees I had heard about him trying to reach out to some magistrates about an idea he had related to the incident at the refugee center I was eager to see what he had planned so I had given him a call to schedule an appointment so that we could more thoroughly discuss matters Send him in I requested hastily discarding the human energy beverage container in my nearby waste bin The door opened once more as the Prestige Exterminator slipped inside He was donned in a classic armored exterminator suit befitting of a prestige underneath a set of formal robes His Medal of Prestige sat pronouncedly atop them Officer Valho I greeted It is wonderful to finally meet you in person Please please sit down I offered gesturing towards the chair across from me So you wanted to talk to me about my idea He asked taking a seat in the chair I had gestures to Yes in due time But first I turned to look at him more personally I heard about the stampede in Bellowing Forest There was a lot of unexpected drama surrounding it Would you care to elaborate Certainly your Honor he affirmed It started during the Sun March meaning more eyes were on it than there would otherwise be However there s also the fact that one of our Junior recruits was almost trampled to death and that there was a human of all people to comfort him Oh that s interesting I assume that this was all rather reality breaking for the herd of people there I asked Indeed it was The human herself actually started to talk down to Commander Dalak I internally cringed at the mention of that petulant zealot remembering how he handled the refugees However the thought of the man being talked down to like the child he is was pleasant enough to maintain my demeanor He actually ended up saying some rather incriminating things with the implication and even limited evidence that he may have started the stampede Soon afterward he was suspended from duty for some time and demoted to Honorary with the threat of termination if he attempted retaliation Oh now that puts a very human smile on my face I see I flicked my ears in approval and from what I understand it was after that you started to seriously petition a proposal of yours I have already looked into that and I want you to know that I think it is a great idea However I still want to ensure there s no misunderstandings so would you care to describe it in your own words for me here Valhi took a moment to think likely trying to differentiate his words from the petition he submitted Well during the incident with the Gojid refugees I found out something that was honestly quite distressing He began Go on I said encouraging him to continue I was curious as to where this would go One of the gojid was physically disabled and we started the construction of a temporary ramp But then Jacob the human on site asked why there wasn t already a permanent ramp constructed He got well he was rather vehement about it I realized then that the Federation has done barely anything to help the disabled other than tell us to figure it out all the while we relied on them for guidance He explained I found myself giving an approving ear flick at that notion It was an unfortunate truth placing it alongside all of the other horrible things about the Federation that were also turning out to be true So Valho continued I decided something Our refusal to properly aid the disabled goes against everything we stand for so why don t we do something about it People deserve their dignity and sovereignty without hindrance Let s make ways for everyone to enter no matter the disability and install permanent ramps on every building He ended his declaration with a stoic expression Yes I wagged my tail in approval and possibly in a bit of anticipation of the caffeine A very admirable goal in my eyes One that I personally agree with However I am curious have you been able to find any magisters or contractors willing to throw their weight behind this proposal Funny you should ask I actually planned to have some support from Dalak However his demotion and suspension prevented that meaning that my success has been limited The most I ve gotten so far are all different variations of We ll consider it Thank you for your time The Prestige explained I wagged my tail This could work quite nicely Well then I m sure you ve heard about that bomb Stampede thing the humans did in the Captiol Well I ll be making a public statement about that soon and I was hoping to also announce that I am throwing my support behind this proposal of yours Valho s eyes widened slightly Really Yes I confirmed I respect you Officer Valho so I won t lie and say that this is all for altruistic reasons I m going to announce that I will be using Magisterial orders to expedite the delivery of the materials to the refugee center being built so that it should be finished within several paws Naturally I anticipate that there will be a lot of backlash This along with a few other proposals I have in mind being included in this would assist in effectively splitting the herd into smaller groups so they can not all rally against me in a single point Valho considered my words That does sound like an effective strategy Instead of having one disagreement that unites them the public will have multiple different disagreements with each other Good to see he catches on fast You are exactly right For example I have a proposal that has been on my desk for a while that would require all electronic stores to sell both Fissan and Nevok products to remove the chance of a monopoly Nice for the consumer but you can see why the shop owners would be upset And I am also accepting agricultural and crop exchanges with Earth as well and I am sure I do not need to describe how that will cause disagreement between herds Valho twitched his ears in thought tapping his claws on his chair s armrest You re right If I remember correctly humans like to wear an almost excessive amount of textiles and the Nevok are the main producers of textiles so that gives more benefit for refugees and more conflict for the herds Oh I had not even considered that He does not need to know that though Indeed I will have to get in contact with some Nevok corporations to draft the documentation but that is currently the only hurdle considering our trade agreements with the Fissians For however long that lasts considering the recent Code Zero called in the Greater Sidestar district Now I leaned forward on my desk doing my best to exude the authority I have as High Magister there is one last thing I want to pass by you This is related to your position as an exterminator and to a personal project of mine Valho looked at me for a moment taking a side to side glance before leaning forward himself Go on My tail swayed in tense anticipation A few paws back after the Extermination Fleet was destroyed I used a portion of my personal funds to send money to Earth as well as make a personal order for both me and the coming refugees An order of articles of clothing I took a deep breath Clothing that is made from the wool of animals named sheep This was the most important part of this meeting Valho was one of the most noble exterminators I knew of but even then he was still an Exterminator This action was directly contrary to his beliefs the use of something originating from another animal But it was also only Wool Something that even Venlil have gathered for their own protective clothing in the harsher environments It was a gray area and the Exterminators were not ones to care for such things Thus how I handled the arrival of those shipments would greatly depend on Valho s response For a moment Valho simply looked at me before turning his head away to think His face scrunched up in deep thought as he mentally debated what I had told him He hummed before reaching a conclusion Hmmmmm It s not Too dissimilar from some practices we ourselves have used in regards to textiles and I assume that the humans are better than to have cruel methods of shearing wool However the implication of using an animal solely for such a purpose won t sit well with many people He explained I realize that I said as I bowed my head in acknowledgment but as a prestige exterminator do you believe it would cause enough strife to elicit a reaction from your main office Will they attempt to attack or destroy anything because of them He huffed negatively Not if it s handled properly Proper tariffs inspections and the approvals of trade These kinds of trades aren t necessarily in the purview of our offices I leaned back letting out a deep sigh My main concern is that their presence will give the exterminators cause to claim me or my staff are tainted enough that they must take action He looked to the side That is a difficult problem to solve His eyes lit up once more Perhaps we can simply turn the people against them I looked at him in confusion How You know how much power Exterminators have If you remember me mentioning it the stampede of Bellowing Forest was caused by Commander Dalak a lead exterminator who is supposed to protect people His actions got a child specifically one of his own recruits almost trampled to death Then the humans first response was to provide comfort and expose Dalak s actions I d say that s a very effective way to tell people that the Humans are not the ones they should be fighting against He explained That would be good I admitted though you do know how the main office always takes such claims That it is always the fault of the individual or single office And Bellowing Forest isn t the same province as Dawn Creek Valho gave me a level gaze You re correct it isn t The Dawn Creek Exterminator Office has more than enough evidence against it already It randomly approached bystanders and tried to torch them without hesitation and now they are threatening and nearly starting an assault upon that old correctional facility Let us not forget about the drug addict of an officer that attacked a woman out in the open without shame to steal from her Granted he had already been fired at the time but the officers still showed they were very familiar with him I breathed deeply to refocus myself So what is the bottom line Your office is essentially setting itself up for war he stated They are causing havoc wherever they go are slowly dividing amongst themselves with their own conflicts and are ensuring innocent people will be hurt or killed if something doesn t change The people will recognize that once all of this is known to them I let out an annoyed huff in response The exterminators had been a tent pole of our city and civilization since time immemorial Even when I saw how truly corrupt and incompetent they were I hadn t thought that there would be a way for people to want their presence removed Yet here right in front of me was a prestige exterminator in his full uniform telling me to basically shut them down Valho I finally decided on saying are you suggesting what I think you are Because if you are that is radical beyond anything I can believe Change is needed for things to progress He stated That is the natural order of things by Solgalick you are also Linked Chains I deadpanned Valho blinked at me before scoffing Not necessarily though I must admit that I would be lying if I said that I didn t agree with some of their rhetoric According to the exterminator definition that is a yes I sighed Even I would have thought that the exterminators were a necessity only a few years ago Someone who can do what police do not Even if I wish to turn people s minds against the office it will take time In nature change is a very slow process promoted by trial and error Eventually however something radical will happen like a mass extinction and the world needs to adapt quickly Valho explained I could not help but whistle in amusement Again that is exactly what LCs teach and for this something radical would be required to happen for me to make major changes with them while I am still in office Something only possible at the level of the Tarlim debacle Sorry to say I don t have any sort of answer for that Valho admitted I shook my ears in the negative Not that I expected you to Yet I have a feeling humans might create such an opportunity I took a breath and picked up my data pad to check the time Okay half a claw Should be long enough I am afraid that we may have gotten distracted in our conversation One of the reasons I called you here is related to a press conference I will be holding in about half a claw Since I shall be supporting your proposal I was wondering if you would like to personally announce that proposal and its contents at the conference Valho s eyes widened in surprise with a glint of elation shining in them I wagged my tail in response I believe you are someone I can work with Having your name and presence would help increase approval for this with the added bonus of a prestige exterminator being on my side splitting the herds of those who would complain I can t say we ll have much time for a rehearsal but if you do wish to join I would be more than willing to have one of the staff work on something with you The Prestige blinked as though taking a minute to make a mental note before standing up and giving me a bow with a happy flick of his ears It would be my honor to attend such a conference with you Rolem My tail wagged the caffeine finally kicking in

Next https www reddit com r NatureofPredators comments bg x of giants and journalist Memory transcript Sol Vah Gojid Exterminator Date Standardized human time October nd Alright everyone Chief Exterminator Kevros squawked You all have your schedules I will see you on patrol He swooped down off the podium leaving all of us to head to our vans after gathering our equipment Nervously trying to keep professional I moved my way through the herd towards the parking garage stopping by the armory to pick up my new torch Our Armorer of the day looked to be Trel a Farsul that Estela had brought in I hadn t interacted with her much because of the new readiness policy we ve enacted since the Extermination fleet Good Paw I greeted Her tail didn t even give a wag back Name and serial I keep myself from drooping my quills at the seemingly rude demeanor It wasn t unexpected our regulations dictated that we should keep a calm and professional demeanor on shift Fraternizing was meant to be saved for breaks and off duty Which meant I wasn t supposed to talk with Kalek or Mute during work hours Right I responded finding that I was nervously tapping my claws on the table Sol Vah She typed in my information into her pad and only then did her tail show a wag You re set on a patrol Kalek will be your back flamer You have been assigned a hand torch a pistol and three spare magazines Remember to refill the torch fuel down by fuel storage before you head out I gave a polite bow removing my claws from the counter Understood Good paw Officer Trel And that was it I was given my uniform and equipment donning it before I strode down towards fuel storage in the basement Good thing it was close to the parking garage lugging the fuel during an emergency would have been rather frustrating I did see a bit more of the office on the way it was still bewildering how much has changed in such a short amount of time As I passed the conference room on my way down I saw our Kholshian Medical officer Nhilasi doing a demonstration on how to properly apply stitching gel upon a wound and dress it up afterwards The dummy she used had a rather ghastly false cut on it though I remember her saying that if we wanted to protect people we would need to tend their wounds as fast as possible without fainting at their sight It was good that she wanted to help people and teach others how to do so as well At least those who were paying attention I hurried the rest of the way down to the lowest floor I still had to pass by the firing range before reaching the fuel stores and parking garage I saw one of our other Kholshian officers Nenikes practicing his aim on the flame course with his Venlil partner Nalja Those two had been part of that embarrassment of a demonstration last paw Completely broke professionalism the second the Giant arrived The whole protest fizzled out in failure after that So they were on training to ensure such an embarrassment doesn t happen again Though there was one thing that came of that incident Turning the corner I saw Kalek filling and pressurizing his flamer at the fuel station I flicked my ears in greeting Good Paw K er Officer Kalek His head swung around so an eye faced me his tail feathers signaling happiness at my presence as he shut off the gas line to his flamer tanks Good Paw Officer Sol Vah I noticed his voice trail off as he looked at me but before I could react he cleared his throat and began gathering his flamer and spare tanks for transport to the van Apologies for my unprofessionalism but I think we need to talk a bit once you re done filling your torch tank Uh oookayyy I watched him head out into the parking garage in confusion as I reached for my torch tank to refill I didn t know what he was on about but ah still got a key chain in my hand Put that away and Wait My thoughts came to a sudden halt at the same moment I opened the fuel line I had keys in my claws Did I pick them up I must have but why is that bothering me I just hmmm Ugh forget it they re in my pocket and I m on shift Just finish filling the tank and get on patrol You re a professional an Exterminator Be how everyone else is supposed to be acting Be the Officer who should have been there for you Be better than the others are being I placed my newly filled torch onto my belt and made my way to the van I saw Kalek in the driver s seat and he gave me a greeting wave with his wing as our eyes made contact I opened up the back to quickly store my equipment on the hangers before jogging over to the passenger side of the van and hopped inside With an approving wave of his feathers Kalek twisted the accelerator driving us up the ramp into the city proper So he inquired as we turned to head towards our designated patrol area for the claw do you want to tell me what has been bothering you I looked at him my quills rising slightly in surprise Bothering I uh sorry I don t know what you re talking about What do you mean He sighed a breath of worry and fear I saw the keys in your claws They weren t yours Not mine I pulled them out of my vest pocket and Two sets Two sets of keys in my claws I thought when had Kalek straightened himself taking a pose I knew well One of authority but one that could be approached One that showed he was disappointed but not closed off You steal stuff when you re upset Unfortunately you re also rather good at it Many don t notice but I ve known you long enough to recognize the signs I tossed the other keys onto the dashboard as if they were burning hot I hadn t even I didn t mean to do that When Kalek s feathers encompassed the fob and plopped it into the central drink holder his eyes still on me as my cheeks burned in shame I thought I had that under control I m not mad promise We can just return those when we get back and say it was an accident but I still want to understand the reasoning behind it Can you tell me what s wrong Do you yourself even know I opened my mouth to deny his claims but just as quickly shut it again He was right something was bothering me but I couldn t put my claw on it I knew I shouldn t be this was arguably the height of my life Our training was better than ever our budget restored and my life made complete by a perfect mate And yet I I don t really know I half lied It s just Things are I stuttered as my brain tried desperately to put into words what was making me so uncomfortable There was something off about everything A fundamental truth somewhere deep in the foundations of my mind that was missing so buried even I myself couldn t quite isolate it alone Hm Kalek clacked as he slowed down the van Having difficulty putting it into words He ducked his beak in acknowledgment I know the feeling all too well In truth ever since our restructuring I ve felt it too if that s any consolation My ears perked up at his words as I looked at him Felt what That we ve lost sight of what we re trying to do he clarified as we stopped at an intersection That we ve gotten so caught up in ourselves that we ve forgotten who we re doing all this for I considered his words as I thought back to what I had seen on the way to the garage People barely managing to stay awake when being taught how to save a life officers learning how to fire weapons with the speed and accuracy to rival an Arxur on the range the lack of any emotion from the guard staff It suddenly clicked for me Kalek was right I yes I sheepishly admitted I m worried that we re starting to let the taint spread to us All these rigid schedules the lack of care and empathy It s I hesitated to say the word predatory even if I knew in my heart it was the best word It s concerning to me We re meant to be protectors but ever since that Extermination fleet failed we haven t protected anything The traffic indicator turned yellow as we started moving again Kalek s crest feathers separated slightly as he drove the middle aged Krakotl staring thoughtfully out the windshield After a moment of silence he turned one of his eyes to me a certain wistfulness obviously present You know I still remember what you said to me when I did that demonstration in the orphanage Still a pup and you held such a drive Oh how many years ago was that now I remembered what he was talking about although I didn t know how this was relevant to the conversation at paw Uh about years at this point What does this have to do with anything When I brought out the paper stand of that predator you leapt up from the kids and slashed it with your claws Everyone else was crying or trying to hide but you didn t he recalled a tinge of nostalgia in his voice I asked you why you did that because at the time I was a rookie officer myself fresher than red algae on the first day of the cool season Do you remember what you said to me that day I couldn t possibly forget that It was the day that I had been given my purpose in the Exterminators and is my most cherished memory I felt a little emotional as I recited the profound words a five year old me had come up with Because I don t want the bad predators to hurt anyone ever again Kalek smiled warmly as we merged into traffic I m glad you recall as well as I do It s that spirit that should be at the heart of the Exterminators a desire to protect the people I knew from that day that you d make a fantastic Exterminator which is why I offered you tutelage under me as a Junior You weren t perfect though You still aren t if I am to be perfectly transparent but that didn t matter I could still see that desire in you even when I couldn t see it in anyone else I thought back to what I could remember of the day the Extermination fleet arrived Everyone was cheering on the fleet even as thousands of Federation Vessels were destroyed in the attack I knew that wasn t what was important but I felt small parts of myself die with each ship blown out of the sky I knew what Kalek meant Nobody was cheering on protection that day Only death and destruction When Estela came in after the Arxur destroyed the fleet I thought things would change She was a prestige exterminator one with a grand record of protecting people I thought her plan outline would be great for the office That we would be ready to protect people I had hoped we would have been what the Exterminators should have been I admitted like I had hoped exterminators to be when I was a kid Kalek bowed his head in understanding Perhaps but at the end of it all we re imperfect creatures I m just sorry that the local office never found out what happened to your parents in the forest They should have searched instead of just burning that place It s not your fault I sighed the conversation starting to dredge up unwanted memories of a time long past You weren t a commander until we moved here You were years off when that all happened I know I know he responded staring out at the road as we sped along I tried to build this place up to an office that would be worth its name When he was still here I worked with Ulmil https www reddit com r NatureofPredators comments spe e the foundations of humanity prequel venlilblooded to make things better To Protect people But Tarlim I completed for him Tarlim he sighed turning to the road that would take us to the edge of the city for our patrol I I saw him as a danger He was so big so strong He could have hurt any of those kids at that school he attended In truth I myself feared him at the time let alone now I understood that fear The feats of strength I had seen him achieve in person were terrifying but it was the ones I heard about that almost passed into fiction I remember reading the report on where the officers had found Treven a good few paws ago Tied up in metal bars bent like they were nothing If he s this strong now it would stand to reason he was then You d be correct Kalek clacked affirmatively Not that he had many opportunities to show it off The herd had already distanced itself from him which only furthered my suspicions Yet looking back with the benefit of retrospect I can t help but believe that my overeagerness has led to the man he is today I cocked my head in thought at his words I m sorry what How could your actions have made him who he is today He was tainted you isolated that taint and you acted upon it Is he That gave me pause Did Kalek actually say that Is he what Is he truly tainted He clarified the buildings becoming fewer and fewer as we moved closer to the edge of the city s development Or have we been chasing phantom predation I blinked a few times trying to process his line of thought It was a complete from what I had expected out of him but I could still hear an uncertainty in his voice I m afraid I don t follow He was a danger After your incident at the welcoming party I did some research about those involved Nothing much for many of the attendees both officers and otherwise One stuck out to me though My breath hitched in my throat remembering that day Yet another painful memory I had been working to suppress resurfaced I didn t want to be rude though especially after my unintentional thievery And who was that Prestige Exterminator Valho I had to restrain myself from physically recoiling at his name Him and that lawyer guy had caused me to dip down into one of the worst lows of my life only eclipsed by losing my parents Yes I remember him Then you remember his story correct About the boy with the wool mites who spent years in a facility I flicked my ears affirmatively as I fought off the terrible feelings associated with the memory of that paw I fear that perhaps I did something similar with Tarlim There it was one of my fears laid bare A repeat of what Valho had spoken to me But Tarlim chose to be near a human I said the one justification that has been whirling through my mind that means he is tainted right We drove in silence in response to the question Kalek just stared out the windshield his feathers raising and lowering in thought I I remember when I first went to the facility after he was imprisoned there he finally said his voice holding a wobble of regret I saw him sitting so close to others in that place and I worried that he might hurt them he let out a deep sigh I am the one who told that place to keep him separated by a minimum distance The defense of the lawsuit was public and as good an officer Mute is he and Treven posed for a photo saying Tarlim was a beast we were holding at bay I didn t stop them the fool I was A vacant look took residence in his eyes Kalek staring at nothing as he carefully drove on patrol I didn t understand where he was going with this and signaled my confusion in another tilt of my head We called him a threat he finally explained We made it so everyone heard that through those years And even though Tarlim won he was alone And our claims kept him alone he let out a deep sigh A thought came to my mind during that bombing party A question Am I truly right to condemn him for taking the first hand to reach out in what looked like kindness When none else would I couldn t answer I became an exterminator to protect people That was my job but Can you even name one person you helped One person you saved I I swallowed I don t know I just don t get how everyone is behaving How everyone is behaving he said under his breath chuckling to himself After a moment though he clacked his beak before speaking again Oh I ve been meaning to tell you I recently got into contact with Gil Derkt again Gil I asked in surprise That s unexpected I haven t heard from him since he entered the exchange program Yes indeed that s the case He says he lost his first partner but entered the program a second time He was partnered with this doctor I had assumed that something had happened to him but he says he just decided he wanted to stay with her Apparently she upgraded his leg brace and they fell for each other He fell for a predator He ruffled his feathers and answered my thoughts before they could even make it to speech And they aren t the only ones I don t get it either Sol Vah All the rules I thought were set in stone are getting overturned just about everywhere I look and yet the protests just fizzled away as if that change wasn t that important Like we re the only ones that are preparing for Brahk I don t even know I knew Preparing for a fight We had been so certain something would happen but now we re just waiting The ferver I had felt during the speech had all but faded replaced with soulless scheduling and mind numbing patrol routes But it had to be true we wouldn t have done all we have done without a reason We were protectors We we have to be I didn t see any signs of predatory influence in the woods as we drove but I needed something to distract myself I didn t like the thoughts that were going through my head They were too dark too depressing Think of something else something positive Something we did right Thankfully at least one good thing came to mind I swung my head back towards Kalek from my sitting position Did you hear about Treven s being brought in It wasn t the most positive topic but keeping that spoiled brat away from us was a good thing in my opinion He ruffled his feathers sounding more steady in his words I was there when he was brought in By Intala he looked like he had been living in an Arxur farm My quills prickled in misplaced concern as I remembered who had deposited him with the exterminators Do you think Tarlim had done something to him When he broke up the protest Kalek flared his tail negatively I interviewed Treven He basically confessed Said he was trying to rob a woman in an alley for not giving him her money Apparently he tried to stab her when he didn t get his way He turned the van down a dirt road through a lumber preserve I think he wanted me to say he deserved the money He was desperate for any kind of approval Rest assured I granted him no such pleasantries I understood why he said that Treven was the odd man out of just about any squad he had been placed in Like he was a pup who still expected the world to give him whatever he wished in a silver salad bowl Despite my distaste with him though I couldn t help but feel sympathetic towards him for what I heard of his decrepit state Still to actually be willing to attack someone just for their money Then what happened to him Why did he need that money so badly Plenty of places are willing to hire former Exterminators I had already heard the rumors That Treven had a stash of Sun Bliss before he was fired but I was hoping beyond hope they weren t true Unfortunately Kalek shattered that with one word Drugs He was on an inhaling stimulant called Sun Bliss I dipped my head in understanding both relieved and disappointed Expectedly though surprise wasn t in my list of emotions So the rumors are true then Do you know how long it s been since his last hit No idea he responded Could have been paws could have been only a claw Either way he needs to get away from its claws After the interview I recommended to Kevros that he get transferred to another province and be put through a correctional facility A correctional facility I shuddered a little Even though ours had been found to be a den run by predators in the skins of prey even standard facilities were not a place one wished to end up I suppose I see the reasoning He was willing to harm others just so he could afford his next hit He s a danger to the herd Indeed Kalek answered solemnly as we continued on our patrol The drive was maddeningly quiet as the silence between us built up into an impenetrable wall I wanted to talk about something with him anything really but I simply couldn t muster the strength It was all being used to ensure that my mind doesn t betray me more than it already has stealing keys I didn t even realize I had stolen and letting old doubts surface once again I just want my shift to be over I just want to be with Mute in his apartment I just want this paw to end Before my depressive line of thinking could continue an alert blared through the communique device embedded in our dashboard Kalek and I shared a glance as he tapped the screen with his wing talon Attention all units All officers Kevros voice rang through the set in a looping message the humans have bombed the Capitol They have set off a bomb Governor Tarva s condition is unknown They are making their move SERIOUSLY NOW To all units This is a full mobilization order Congregate at the old Correctional Facility and the main Office We must remain strong for their attack We must show them we won t back down We must show the Strength of The Herd I swear Kalek drove the van back to the office like he wanted it to take off to the air amp x B First https www reddit com r NatureofPredators comments ooj of giants and journalists Prev https www reddit com r NatureofPredators comments xcr of giants and

        "cleaned_text": "I know its long but its worthwhile I promise For starters I am white and from Australia So my experiences could not be called racism It is more subtle and harder to prove which is why some often wonder if I am actually imagining all this I have now lived in Germany for the past years half my life I switched citizenship in and now possess only the German one The German government required me to give up my Australian one I speak near perfect German but with an accent But I have come to the conclusion that Germans construct a barrier around themselves when interacting with people who don t belong to their tribe I feel that if you were not born in this country you will never have a sense of fully belonging to German society And even if you were born here you may still have problems I e not being white There are always subtle traits of Germans letting you know that you are not one of them This can involve Switching to English I still have not yet met a German who speaks better English than I speak German and this is not just me being egoistic I don t need help with my German I am not an English teacher on wheels who gives free lessons But this happens to me every day even with people I have known for years But in a deeper sense I think switching to English mid conversation is an unconscious method of protecting their tribe from outsiders I e the same way that a couple may have a certain romantic cute way of speaking to each other alone Germans like to protect their language and only speak it with their kind And here I am not talking about at the mter or in the train where newly arrived foreigners are forced to speak German but rather with people I actually know and who know my German level Completely ignoring me when I ask a question And no this is not because they didn t understand my German I e pretending they didn t hear Switching eye contact from me to my German girlfriend as soon as they hear my accent Example I was on holidays in Greece and we met another German couple by chance multiple times in a restaurant They remembered us and offered us the remainder of their wine bottle because they wanted to go Probably since I was the man they both directed their initial conversation at me This particular time it took them a few minutes to pick up on my accent But as soon as they detected it they seemed really confused if not threatened After that including multiple other times where we popped into each other in some other villages nearby they did not look at me and their focus shifted to my girlfriend which is ironic because she was ignored at first for being a woman they wanted approval from the man regarding the wine bottle Continously emphasizing the fact that you are not from Germany All of the above and other such similar subtle things have happened to me every day in Germany for the past years They happen too often for me to be imagining them A lot of people say it is better in some other continental European countries In terms of simple interactions like in a caf or on the street it is indeed easier and more relaxed in France the Netherlands Denmark etc However in terms of being accepted into society it is exactly the same as in Germany and in Sweden or the Netherlands I would say it is even much worse their tribes are much smaller the German tribe so it needs to be protected even more For example imagine if a year foreigner moves to a continental European country gets citizenship learns the language to near perfect becomes accustomed to the culture history etc years later will the native ethnic citizens accept this person as a German Frenchman woman Dane etc Absolutely not at least of them will not If that same people moves to Australia US Great Britian Canada New Zealand Absolutely yes at least say will accept them as one of their own There are two reasons for this For a large portion of the continental Europe I e in Germany AFD CDU voters nationality ethnicity For the remainder at an absolute minimum you have to be born there go to school there speak the language without an accent etc Auf Deutsch sozialisiert This explains why most young progressive Germans would actually consider a year old of Turkish Italian Russian Greek Polish origin to be one of them but do not consider me to be one of them even if I have lived in the country far longer I grew up in Sydney and there I knew multiple immigrants who were in the same situation as me now they had lived about years in Australiaa and were about But not for a second did I even think about whether they actually belonged to this society and whether they were as Australian as me Of course they were But I am willing to maintain that not one of the million Germans considers me as German as they are I originally thought it was an American Australian Canadian thing I e countries which have had huge immigration waves for hundreds of years But that doesn t explain why immigration is generally speaking much more successful in the UK than in continental Europe Therefore the only logical conclusion is that it is an Anglo Saxon thing More precisely an English thing all the Anglo Saxon countries have internationally relatively speaking an English mentality Sure most immigrants to the US came from other countries but these new immigrants adopted the existing English mentality very quickly Now the question is Why are the English Or possibly the British more accepting of outsiders into their society I don t have a definite answer to this But maybe one possibility is that the UK has not been invaded by foreigners since There was widespread unrest and even civil wars up until but it was always Brit vs Brit or Englishman vs Englishman Now compare this to continental Europe Nonstop wars tribe vs tribe for the last years right up until and in some cases even later Balkans Ukraine Think about the years war in Germany the Swedish arrived raped the woman killed the men burnt the villages and stole the harvest The Spanish did the same thing the Netherlands for years from onwards And Germans of course were the experts in this field All these conflicts involved one tribe against another tribe right up until and in terms of the historical mentality it is very very recent however is a long time ago Therefore I believe in continental Europe the mentality has developed a natural defense mechanism against anything foreign When such an encounter happens Europeans retreat into their own tribe as an unconscious protection mechanism By the way Germany more immigrants as a percentage of popluation than the US and the UK Large scale immigration to the UK also started at the same time as Germany in the s So the argument we are still getting used to immigrants is completely bogus Some people have mentioned to me that that s just the way it is in Germany continental Europe and that immigrants must accept this when choosing to migrate there I e why should these countries change their whole mentality assuming that this is even possible to do because of some whining foreigners On a superficial level this is true Maybe I should just leave Although I have no chance of getting back into Australia at and immigrating at that age is not that easy I e meeting new friends But continental Europeans have to consider this How do you seriously expect to compete in the st century if most first generation immigrants including very highly skilled ones don t feel part of the society Germany and the rest of continental Europe attracts hardly any Chinese Indian and African highly skilled workers compared the Anglo Saxon countries E g only of Germany s regular i e excluding refugees immigration is from outside of the EU This immigration is a movement from poorer EU countries to richer ones At some point this immigration will stop or greatly reduce as Central Europe and countries like Spain and Portugal are growing much faster than Germany The most ironic thing about all of this is that I left Australia because I hated it and generally also the Anglo Saxon mentality This was during the Iraq war I wanted to live in a country that was proactive on environmental issues had good public transportation despite the situation now in Germany its public transportation is still way better than in Anglo Saxon countries had good bike infrastructure see point about transportation free health care didn t start wars that had citizens who were were informed on world issues And to be fair I got all of these things by moving here However all of these things are nothing compared with the need to have a feeling of being accepted So the ironic thing is that each day I am developing a larger and larger Anglo Saxon superiority complex I guess I am being forced to retreat into the protection of my tribe Germany I tried I learnt the language to a high level I immersed myself in your literature film music I lived in Bundesl nder Munich Berlin Greifswald Bochum I joined sports clubs I joined a political party But you never treated my any differently from just another random tourist who was in Berlin for the weekend To save my dignity I got bitter I mentally returned to my people to my tribe"

        "cleaned_text": "The San Diego Humane Society is planning to hire a private investigator to find out what happened to hundreds of rabbits guinea pigs rats and hamsters it transferred this summer to its Arizona counterpart even as two of the Tucson shelter s leaders depart over the ongoing mystery The San Diego nonprofit is also looking to pursue legal action We will pursue this as far as we need to find out where our animals went Dr Gary Weitzman its president and CEO said this week It s been nearly two months since the local shelter transferred small animals to the Humane Society of Southern Arizona in Tucson to alleviate pressure on its local shelters But questions quickly arose after the Tucson shelter declined to share any information about the whereabouts of of the animals Although the animals were reportedly adopted out through a private rescue organization that wanted to remain anonymous animal advocates concerns grew when no one could find a rescue center capable of handling animals let alone getting them all adopted in just a few weeks In a response to a demand letter sent Sept from the San Diego organization s attorneys the Tucson group s attorneys placed the blame again on their counterpart reiterating its contention that it had been forthright about their plans SDHS has dragged HSSA through the mud as SDHS diverts negative attention created by its own spotlight the letter dated Sept read After weeks of back and forth the Tucson organization s board of directors decided Friday to suspend its CEO Steve Farley and its chief programs officer Christian Gonzalez On Thursday Robert Garcia the board s chair said Farley had since been fired and Gonzalez had resigned To Weitzman it s the first glimpse of hope that the Tucson group is taking the matter seriously This really feels like the first time that things are moving toward a more productive conversation he said The transport the largest in the San Diego Humane Society s history was initiated as the local shelter reached a record number of animals in its care Though in California it is illegal for pet stores to sell dogs cats and rabbits other small animals don t have the same legal protections That s part of why so many of these animals land in shelters Weitzman explained It s a critical practice in animal welfare to transport animals to a place where there may be more of a potential for them to get into homes Weitzman said Farley previously told the San Diego Union Tribune that when they arrived from San Diego of the small animals were immediately transferred to what he described as small family run family funded rescue that the Tucson shelter had worked with for over a decade The private rescue reportedly had adopters lined up for weeks and only about of those animals were not immediately adopted Farley said Even so Weitzman remains skeptical of the entire transaction Though the incident has garnered publicity in both San Diego and Arizona Weitzman pointed out that no adopters have come forward to say the animals are safe He also noted that although the roughly rabbits his organization transferred to Arizona had microchips none of those that were allegedly adopted have updated the owner information which adoptive families would typically do with new pets In a statement released Saturday the Tucson board said they ve been in communication with the private group who say the animals were placed in adoptive homes The board is aware of no evidence to the contrary and presently has no evidence indicating any animal was harmed However the board decided to hire an independent investigator suspending Farley and Gonzalez to ensure the integrity of this investigation and that anybody inside or outside the Tucson shelter with information could come forward with it without fear of retaliation As people who care deeply about animals we understand well the significant interest in ensuring the animals are OK the board s statement read While this private group does not maintain adoption records in the manner that a large organization like HSSA does we are looking for all the information available formal or not The Tucson group did not respond to the Union Tribune s request for further comment The board s response came days after animal advocates held protests outside Garcia s law offices last week demanding answers regarding the animals fates Protest leader Kelly Galligan who has for years worked with the Tucson shelter as the president of the board of the Bisbee Animal Shelter says the goal was to demand action from the Tucson board This organization is much needed in this part of Arizona and we can t afford for them to go down so the board needs to do their job Galligan said I think this is just going to be the impetus for the overhaul that was really needed anyway with the leadership Animal advocates have also created a Change org petition to demand the Tucson group be held accountable The petition which had over signatures as of Wednesday details some advocates suspicions that the missing animals may have been sold as live food for snakes Weitzman has also heard these suspicions but had yet to hear direct confirmation of the animals fates from the Tucson shelter as of Tuesday We want to stay optimistic but it s just getting harder and harder to do so he said Weitzman says that he and the San Diego group won t be letting up pressure either Anyone with information can contact the Humane Society of Southern Arizona s board of directors via email at board hssaz org For updates about the San Diego Humane Society s efforts visit sdhumane org transportupdate"

        "cleaned_text": "My husband and I visited your city in early October and I wanted to share our itinerary and experiences Originally the plan was to visit Niagara Falls for our anniversary then it morphed from there so we had the pleasure of exploring Toronto for six days while my MIL graciously watched our toddler giving us a lovely chance to reconnect and explore You all gave me great recommendations in r askTO This is long but I hope entertaining If not TL DR is bulleted our itinerary under each day of the week Day Kaka sushi buffet Nathan Phillips Square Grange Park Toronto Public Library A lot of aimless walking After driving through grueling Boston traffic to Logan airport in the morning we flew and landed at Pearson airport in the afternoon and OF COURSE the UP Express had a signaling issue and was out of service just as we stepped up to the ticket machine The area quickly filled with travelers in the same boat as us so I downloaded Uber and we got a ride to the hotel After checking in we chose KAKA sushi buffet because we were so hungry Had our first city character encounter as we called them We walked to Nathan Phillips Square next which seemed fitting with a huge Toronto sign cool It was a very concrete area Maybe it s more lively in the summer We took our touristy photo and walked on through Grange Park where my husband tried to befriend the black squirrels they re gray in MA More walking We stopped at one of your libraries as respite aka our of the sun and googling where to go next I bought a slushie at a cafe then we head to a pharmacy to buy distilled water for my husband s CPAP machine but just our luck there was a cash only sign on the door so we walked further to a store I think had tire in the name but did not sell tires Got back to the hotel very tired and carrying a big jug of distilled water and powerade with no bag and realized we forgot to buy snacks So that sucked Day UFO Restaurant West Queen West Trinity Bellwoods Park CN Tower Ripley s Aquarium St Lawrence Market Dog Fountain Loblaw s dinner We didn t have much of a plan beyond Vietnemese breakfast at UFO and exploring West Queen West by recommendation Unfortunately a lot of shops were not open yet as we walked but we did get a book at TYPE books and a probably too expensive toy for our toddler at Kol Kid Coffee in hand we sat at the edge of Trinity Bellwoods Park and decided since it was such a nice day to do CN Tower today for the best view We made a lunch reservation and for some ungodly reason decided to walk to it Dining at CN Tower was definitely worth it Amazing experience eating while the city spins around us and food was great especially the desserts I felt underdressed since we didn t plan on going that day oh well We then visited Ripley s Aquarium which was fantastic I m so used to New England Aquarium which is centered around one giant tank you spiral up and around that all the different tanks were delightful The octopus was HUGE And jellyfish tank soooo cool And that moving platform through the tank tunnels and sharks and turtles swimming around and overhead Phenomenal I also liked how they show you the filtration tanks What a great aquarium especially for kids There was still plenty of day left so we walked so much walking to St Lawrence Market and explored Bought fancy honey and treats We were about to eat but alas our option was cash only So we grabbed coffees and sat around Berczy Park Dog Fountain We decided to end the day with a romantic grocery store sandwich and rice ball dinner at Loblaws to balance out our insane lunch bill Day Tim Hortons Niagara Falls Journey Behind the Fall Flying Saucer restaurant Hornblower Clifton Park Wendys Time for Niagara Falls The public transport experience around the Falls was the worst part of our trip We took the morning GO Train which was a smooth ride with the downside we had a long ass day until the pm train Also I am still confused on ticket scanning No one ever checked our GO tickets I never understood scanning tickets after we hop off and if that was even the case for GO when the little kiosk scanners say Presto I know we need to buy a WeGo ticket No problem the outdated train announcement even said so I look on my phone and the WeGo website is far from helpful All I see is a day pass on a different website We are unceremoniously deposited at Niagara and the important looking building we re dropped off at is closed so we walk to a rickety bus stop that looks like it s out of a road trip comedy movie It sure gave that experience because there was no toilet paper in my stall so thank goodness I had stuffed a napkin in my pocket from my bland Tim Hortons breakfast Cherry on top after the bathroom is my husband informing me that not only do you need to buy a pass not a single ticket but the passes are cash only GREAT I m purchasing the suspect hour pass on my phone as the bus comes and leaves We wait around with other confused tourists who didn t get their shit together in time either I get on the bus and the lady tells me they don t accept the pass on my phone I ask what did I just buy then She says I can show my phone to the Niagara Falls bus kiosk to get a pass Seems backwards and I could go on but I m complained enough to you all but ok We re on the bus and get the pass Later I learned not only is there no single ride fare there s no hour pass only the hour pass Finally at the Falls it s breathtaking I see my sad American side comrades on the other side of the river and feel bad they re not getting the view we re getting We get our tourist pics and ooh and aww We do Journey Behind the Falls which is neat and we wait for people to take minute video of rushing water in a cave they will never look at again until we can look Hungry for lunch and rightfully warned not to eat at Clifton Hill we take a bus up and to the Flying Saucer diner which was tasty Now we have a conundrum We definitely want to go on the Hornblower but are worried about timing to do anything else being at the mercy of bus and train schedules So we go on the Hornblower which was WILD Holy shit I have never done something so to This wasn t mist it was a rainstorm I m convinced the boat took us closer than they normally do Ponchos barely kept our torsos dry We were in soaked sneakers for another hours which I spent wondering why they don t have a giant heater for folks to use after I d pay money to feel dry I could go on about my money making idea around this Now we re stuck We feel we don t have enough time to take a bus enjoy another experience then take a bus back and up to the train station We would ve rushed through Ripley s Museum so instead we aimlessly wandered around the tacky Clifton Hill With little choice we split a Wendy s meal and eat it by the Falls which is brilliantly lit up for the night which is beautiful and kind of funny because we re eating fast food As we walk to our bus stop we see our bus pass us and it s then an anxiety ridden and stressful long wait for the last bus that gets us to our train just in time Day Culinary Adventure Co food tour Jimmy s coffee Art Gallery of Toronto Darvish Persian Restaurant Our feet were seriously killing us by day My husband had blisters on top of his other foot problems I ll spare you the details of but we powered through the Kensington Market Chinatown walking food tour with Culinary Adventure Co that was recommended here which I also highly recommend Our guides were lovely and the food varied and delicious while learning about the area We took a break at Jimmy s Coffee then head to the Art Gallery of Toronto Why is there a framed portrait of My Little Pony Artwork We were bamboozled into walking up the spiral staircase and warned people it wasn t worth it on our way down We love trying new food and had never ate Persian before so we chose Darvish and were not disappointed We rested our weary bones in the hotel hot tub again that night Day Frans breakfast Royal Ontario Museum Dimmi Bar amp Trattoria Dessert Lady This was one of my favorite days We had a nice big breakfast at Frans then spent four hours at the Royal Ontario Museum I love museums so I was really looking forward to this one because of the variety of exhibits I could ve spent much longer at the gemstone exhibit because the samples were so fascinating to look at The evolution of style exhibit was unique but my favorite part had to be the dinosaur extinct animals exhibit especially the sabertooth and direwolf skeletons We ended the night with Dimmi Bar amp Trattoria which had very friendly staff Grabbed some baked goods from the Dessert Lady then ate them back at our hotel with Cotti Coffee We wanted to go to a comedy club show at some point but we were simply too tired at the end of each night Our feet were seriously in pain Day Egg Bae Explored Union Station Love Park A slow morning before our evening flight home We used our Cotti Coffee coupons for coffee then ate one of the most impressive breakfast sandwiches we ve ever had at Egg Bae We made the horrible mistake of taking an accessibility elevator down to the subway and had to hold our breath because of the multiple puddles of half way dried pee inside I made a mental note to clean my shoes when I got home Since we had an awkward amount of time before having to head to the airport we spent it taking our time exploring Union Station where we grabbed some snacks for our flight then walked over to Love Park to kill time Some good karma came our way when it was time to buy our UP Express tickets The man in front of us only took his receipt not his ticket and he was long gone into the crowd by the time we confirmed it So free ticket for us Didn t see a confused man later so assumed he got on just fine especially because the employee didn t actually look at the tickets Flew home and finished with the final travel stress of minutes of panic where we couldn t locate our car keys they were within a pocket in a pocket in our backpack Final notes A LOT of cannabis stores And dentists The streetcar system was neato until I read about the bedbugs Holy sales tax Batman I love the museum variety We got by without exchanging USD for CAD though having some would have saved us some inconveniences Had fun Toronto"

        "cleaned_text": "Two Days Later The teleportation energies faded around them Rob stumbled for a moment yet only a moment He was well accustomed to the aftereffects of teleportation magic His allies less so A cacophony of unhappy groans serenaded him and several pairs of eyes glared at him accusingly as if asking why he was never affected too badly by this Sorry but as a good friend once said I m just built different Rob put on an apologetic grin as he stepped past Riardin s Rangers Diplomacy the Elders Seneschal Sylpeiros Overseer Nelrith and a handful of coalition soldiers all who were still recovering A Fiend messenger was waiting at the other end of the teleportation chamber watching the sight with open mouthed stupefaction Deadlands Squad reporting for duty Rob said saluting her Can you bring us to wherever the Overseers are Kind of on a time crunch here The messenger s eyes shimmered with the telltale sign of Identify Her mouth somehow dropped further Rob snapped his fingers in front of her face Mmhmm Level very impressive I get it Where are the Overseers She jumped an inch into the air Yes Of course Rob King Rob His face wrinkled with disgust as if someone had waved rotten meat under his nose Absolutely not Just the name is fine While saying yes probably would ve helped solidify his position the notion of people calling him lofty titles filled him with deep seated revulsion He wasn t a King or an Overseer or a Seneschal or a Warden Leader was merely a tool he employed to make people listen Lord was about the most he was willing to roll with and even that didn t really pass the smell test None of them were him Rob was Rob Although Blightkiller had been cool He would accept that one if people used it It was by far the title he d earned the most Once everyone got back on their feet the messenger quickly led them through a series of empty hallways Sylpeiros and the non Fiend coalition soldiers were gazing every which way on high alert seeming to expect soul munching horrors to emerge from the shadows at any moment Rob almost chuckled at the looks on their faces before remembering that the Fiends had tried assassinating Riardin s Rangers more often than any other race Everything was cool now but only after the Deserters paved the way for reconciliation He wouldn t blame the newbies for being a tad nervous It didn t take long to reach the Overseers conference room Which in reality was a repurposed mess hall with some bells and whistles slapped on for vanity s sake They d set up shop as closely as possible to the teleportation chamber Here we are the messenger said stepping aside and gesturing to a pair of scuffed double doors The Overseers await within The coalition soldiers stayed outside while pretty much everyone else entered Rob Sylpeiros and Overseer Nelrith went in because they were high ranking officials Riardin s Rangers went in because they were part of Rob s entourage The Elders went in because no one wanted to tell them no Diplomacy went in because no one could tell them no without having the word somehow twisted around into a confession of their innermost secrets Rob was greeted by a nostalgic sight as he stepped inside a group of Fiends seated at the opposite end of a table trying their best to look imposing All it needed was Overseer Nelrith to complete the set and there she went heading over to join her compatriots It s been some time she said her shoulders dropping as if releasing a long held tension Indeed One of the Overseers gave her a welcoming nod It is heartening to see that you have returned alive and well Nelrith He turned to face Rob As have you The journey south was more perilous than any of us anticipated but from what we ve heard our coalition prevailed nonetheless Elatra is now safe from the Blighted Leader who sought to bring ruination to our lands Rob didn t know how to respond to that It felt a little disarming to hear the last few months of his life condensed so succinctly Like all the battles death strife pain and skin of their teeth moments had only been worth one paragraph in a newspaper article depicting some far off conflict Then again that was how Fiendland experienced the Harpy war through sporadic letters sent by teleportation mages to keep their homeland apprised of the situation Do they understand how dire it truly was he wondered And how much worse it nearly became Overseer Nelrith knew but that was because she d lived it He couldn t expect the others to treat it with the same weight he did That went triple for the general Fiend populace Rob doubted that they d known anything except for the bare minimum needed to explain why Roy wasn t coming back for a while Informing them of a potential Blight invasion would ve accomplished nothing besides inciting a panic anyway Guess that s just how it is Wasn t a bad thing really Elnaril fading into obscurity outside of his home territory was exactly the legacy that sadistic prick deserved I think we did alright for our first diplomatic trip Rob said taking a seat across from the Overseers They re not all like that I hope No Sylpeiros grunted I ve attended many and none have resulted in spearheading a reckless charge into the heart of enemy territory None until you got involved Rob gave him two thumbs up Glad to keep things interesting He glanced at the Overseers So did you We ve followed your instructions Overseer affirmed The teleportation mages who previously transported you to the Elven Village have been accruing mana for some time now They will be ready tomorrow at the latest We have also gathered food and supplies for your journey including Anti Corruption Amulets and some Hazmat Suits He paused Do you sincerely intend to venture into the Deadlands Yeah we do Thanks for the help uh Rob trailed off Overseer frowned then let out a scandalized squawk Did you just cast Identify on me the Fiend queried aghast Maybe Rob scratched the back of his head I m doing my best to remember people s names these days but it s work in progress The Overseer named Varghan apparently looked like he wanted to leave the room and take a long nap This from the man who calls himself our Leader With those words the temperature in the room seemed to drop by several degrees Is that going to be a problem Rob asked in an excessively casual tone Diplomacy had warned him that there might be pushback when he returned to Fiend territory Authority figures never gave up influence without a fight and even though Rob was Level and a famous hero in their society he was still a Human At worst the Overseers may have run a smear campaign sabotaging his public image while he was stuck dealing with Elnaril This is a complicated dilemma Nelrith began preempting the argument that was about to burst forth No one can deny that you are a pillar of Fiend territory In the months since we first met you ve already saved us thrice over The Corruption plague Titan s Fist and Elnaril were all calamities averted by your efforts She paused And if I am to be blunt we could not oppose you if you pressed the matter Riardin s Rangers would burn half our territory to the ground before we stopped you If we stopped you Oh brother Rob rolled his eyes Do you people always have to be so dramatic No territories are getting burnt down promise I m here to work with you guys not lord over people like a tyrant Me being Leader helps you as well Fiend territory is going to be participating in international negotiations moving forward and having the strongest Combat Class user in the world as your representative will count for a lot We know the benefits Varghan muttered But you do realize that this has never happened before yes Members of one race cannot become the Leader of a different territory It simply isn t done How would you know that Fiend territory has been isolated until now For all you Actually Elder Alessia interrupted his assumption is correct Rob blinked Oh Well What can I say I m a trendsetter The Overseers exchanged unreadable glances After a few seconds Varghan leaned forward Goroth did not return with you No Rob lowered his gaze He didn t Forgive me for broaching his death in this manner I don t mean to imply that you are to blame for what transpired However it is a solemn fact that Goroth was perhaps the most stalwart supporter of Fiend territory He trained and led people for centuries and before Faelynn s ascent he was considered to be our strongest fighter Yet despite his many virtues he still declined to take up a position of greater importance because he realized the gravity of such a decision I think he should have Rob thought It wasn t something he would say out loud to grieving Fiends but in his eyes Goroth had sort of wasted his potential Elatra needed more people in power with that much honesty and moral fiber And while the Overseers were dressing up Goroth s reluctance in pretty words Rob disagreed with that assessment as well Rather than Goroth having carefully considered all angles what it really boiled down to was that he just hadn t wanted to lead He d preferred it when someone else made the final call Rob would never condemn that sentiment Leadership wasn t necessarily some higher calling everyone should aspire to But if he personally had to choose between following or leading He would do both actually Follow credible advice from people he trusted and lead Elatra back down the right path when it inevitably tried to get all war crime y again Let me finish what you re about to say he cut in You re worried that compared to Goroth who already thought he wasn t worthy I don t measure up I m less experienced and less loyal The only thing I have on him is Levels which as our darling Queen Ragnavi has so plainly shown does not automatically make for a good Leader Rob shook his head The thing is experience is something that s solved with time Teach me and I ll learn Loyalty is a different matter but if you ask me it s honestly better that I m not quite as loyal as Goroth He probably would ve been ride or die for you guys even if Fiend territory was in the wrong With me we ll keep each other honest That would still mean that our Leader is a Human Varghan pointed out A human of Earth yes Not Elatra I don t come with any of the baggage or hangups that a native here would To me Fiends are the same as any other race Earth from what we understand you wish to return to your home world one day I do and I will Unfortunately I m also planning to commute back and forth Rob let out an aggrieved sigh Alas I ve made friends here and found someone I love so now I m invested in this dumpster fire of a world You can trust me to stick around and strive for a brighter future And like hell I m quitting after putting in so much work Gonna take my sunk cost straight to the bank Overseer Varghan hesitated struggling with what to say He seemed to be preparing a rebuttal when Nelrith shook her head Then all at once the fight went out of him Just tell me this he said in a near whisper as if speaking to a funeral casket Did Goroth die well The question hit Rob like a freight train While he was stunned Orn tol immediately stepped forward the boy loudly raising his voice Goroth saved my life He Orn tol swallowed a lump in his throat and when he continued speaking his voice quavered with the guilt of a survivor I wish I could ve thanked him Varghan looked from Orn tol to Rob Trust he murmured An endorsement The highest kind possible He looked to Faelynn the Fiend who d spent the most time around Rob You would put your faith in him Unequivocally she replied without missing a beat That seemed to remove the last of his doubt Varghan nodded then stood up Very well If any here oppose Rob the Human s status as Leader now is the time to make your peace None did Diplomacy clapped their hands together Excellent I congratulate you on achieving the rare compromise where both parties aren t left unhappy Although I would recommend reversing whatever forms of political sabotage you were implementing against Rob Might get awkward when you announce he s the new Leader Sabotage Varghan barked out an incredulous laugh As if we could The Gods Edict practically declared him to be the savior of the world and more importantly do you have any notion of how much our coffers are being bolstered by profiting from his image Theater plays wooden carvings autograph replicas painted portraits Argath preserve it s like conjuring money from thin air Rob raised a finger aloft Okay that s my first official policy as Leader I want a piece of that cash cow A fair piece so don t go complaining If I had to deal with half the goddamn country getting my name wrong I deserve to get paid for it The Overseers collectively froze You were never reimbursed Nelrith sounded like he d just told her that the moon was made of cheese I did think it strange when you once paid a vendor in HP Potions but no that s impossible Varghan should ve been responsible for handling those affairs What I most certainly was not He pointed to a different Overseer She was in charge I assure you In the end each Overseer blamed another for the Party s financial standing Faelynn was the only one with a salary and that was just a holdover from her time as a Fiend soldier No one in the room was more baffled than Diplomacy who after examining the Overseers with widened eyes declared that they were somehow all telling the truth A small part of Rob wanted to be exasperated A larger part of him thought that this was the funniest thing he d ever seen and that it would give him extra leverage moving forward I must say Sylpeiros suddenly remarked This is different from what I expected Nelrith glared at him And what were you expecting Ritual blood sacrifices A buffet consisting of the finest souls You ve traveled and fought with my people for months now Seneschal You know we aren t the ravenous beasts that other territories have painted us as To know is different than to experience He swept his gaze across the room contemplating something How many of your people have learned to speak Common More each day The process is slow as rushing it can lead to grievous bodily harm She grimaced It would be easier if your people learned our language but as every other race speaks Common we recognize that the onus for communication largely rests on our shoulders Sylpeiros raised an eyebrow Learning to speak a language can cause grievous bodily harm I ll explain later Rob said He d forgotten to mention that bit when giving his lecture on why the gods were assholes Fiends learning to speak Common or non Fiends learning to speak Fiendish could literally kill someone if done too quickly It was one of the restrictions the gods had put in place to foster conflict between races Without Rob recognizing Fiendish as Spanish and without the gods being plagiarizing hacks the language barrier would ve likely never been breached After a moment Sylpeiros shrugged in acceptance turning to face the Overseers You ll be delighted to know that I have judged your people he said in a lofty tone and have concluded that you are perfectly boring I can t believe that a Leader s ascension was resolved without at least one person being beaten into the ground My routine negotiations with Ragnavi were more fraught with tension than this He smirked and for once there even seemed to be some contentment in it I have no issue with extending our alliance beyond the necessity of our current troubles How kind of you Nelrith drawled Shall we discuss details then Rob suppressed a grumble as they got down to brass tacks Second official policy I m hiring someone to attend long winded meetings for me Mercifully their talk didn t last much longer than that The Overseers codified Fiendland s alliance with Sylpeiros and some additional measures for the Deadlands Tour were mentioned such as Fiendland using Dwarven made radios delivered from Spatial Storage to keep in touch while the Tour was underway Nerasi had been reluctant to part with the devices yet they were too useful to hoard in times of need Another idea that Rob suggested was to utilize the city wide barrier that the Fiends had created in Broadwater Back then it was strong enough to keep out a grown Blight for weeks straight He d hoped they might have improved upon the spell since but according to the Overseers the barrier s limitations remained the same It was still stationary and it still required over fifty Fiends using Soul Burn to form That made it largely impractical for anything besides fortifying defenses in one location and at a very great cost In a way the Fiends barrier highlighted how absurd Purge Corruption and Vul to s Soul Barrier were Those Skills could destroy and repel the Blight respectively with no detriment to their user For others to perform an equivalent feat numerous people needed to forfeit their own lives converting life essence into raw mana to achieve what Rob and Vul to could do whenever they pleased Although when viewed from the opposite perspective Soul Burn seemed just as absurd Purge Corruption was a unique Skill granted by the Skills themselves They d never figured out Vul to s deal but for all they knew he was a product of the Skills intervention as well Neither of their abilities or Sub Classes were ever meant to exist yet Soul Burn could replicate and surpass them When fifty Fiends used Soul Burn they could make a barrier with enough strength to forestall the Blight When a thousand people used Soul Burn they could make a spell capable of vanquishing a Blight in one explosive blast When an entire race used Soul Burn they could make a Cataclysm So yeah no Fiend barrier Purge Corruption and strength of arms would have to suffice The Overseers ended the meeting by asking Rob to give a speech to the public where he would assuage their fears and announce his rise to the station of Leader Rob objected on the grounds that giving canned speeches was a miserable experience that made him feel like a used car salesman They settled on him writing an inspiring message that would be propagated throughout the territory via letters and Message Crystals One of the Overseers suggested holding onto some letters then selling them later as collector s items once interest was drummed up In spite of the Overseers many conspiracies and political schemes Rob had never felt like he d made a deal with the devil until he watched them invent scalping in real time After that it was just a matter of waiting The teleportation mages would be ready tomorrow morning Riardin s Rangers considered taking a stroll through Acrastor City to keep themselves occupied but decided against it They didn t want to grow accustomed to being back in what was essentially their home only to set off on another life threatening journey the very next day Rob did however make one pit stop to visit an old friend acquaintance coworker that is Urian He grinned wide as he stepped into the Artificer s workshop Haven t seen you in months How s A blur rushed at him His hand snapped out catching the projectile before it could smack him in the forehead Hello to you too Rob muttered glancing at the compass held safely in his palm You re lucky I didn t attack whatever this is out of reflex Not the smartest His voice failed him as he turned his gaze towards Urian s workshop The place was in even more chaotic disarray than usual as if a horde of rampaging gorebeasts had plowed through without a care Papers were scattered across the floor scorch marks peppered the walls and a liquid that looked suspiciously like acid was dripping from a hole in the ceiling Then there was Urian himself The aged Elf sported dark circles under his eyes and unkempt hair that stood on end He d also never looked prouder than this very moment It Is Done Rob peered at the compass and cast Identify Name Compass of Corruptive Tracking Description This Enchanted Item always points to the nearest Dungeon Its range is limitless It cannot be broken or damaged outside of exceptional means Holding it slightly accentuates the taste of sugar Sugar Rob started with That s what you re focused on Bah Urian flopped back into a chair sighing If you must know this compass was originally a minor Enchanted amulet that I reforged into the Item you see now Rob examined the compass in more detail It didn t appear to be perfectly circular as if it had been hammered into shape by hand and the internal needle was made of carved wood He slowly moved the device from side to side eyebrows raising when the needle stayed stubbornly pointed at somewhere out in the southwest Why not just use a real compass as a base Artificers are slaves to our Inspiration Urian explained sounding oddly chipper Hesitating when the feeling strikes no matter how it strikes means losing an opportunity When I witnessed that plume of Corruption erupting from the Deadlands like a fetid spear of miasma it spoke to me My Inspiration bade me to craft this Enchanted Item as such and so I did He yawned stretching wearied arms and then closed his eyes That compass is unique There is no Enchanted Item of its like anywhere else in the world Which I might add makes this the third Item effect I have created wholesale from nothing in the span of a year Do not expect another for a very very long time Rob idly tapped his finger on the compass Admittedly he would ve preferred a mega death ray to kill Blights from afar but that was probably asking for too much Besides Urian had a stellar track record when it came to forging Enchanted Items that wound up more useful than anticipated He d created the Amulet of Allocation meant to allow Party members to share passive bonuses which ended up also allowing Rob to share Fast Learner He d upgraded the Ring of Waterbreathing months before it became vital to entering Merfolk territory He d made the Ring of Disguise so Vul to could hide his new Fiend body only for Vul to to reject it and for the Item to help Diplomacy to live a semi normal life This compass may not be a death ray but it would likely come in handy in unexpected ways Nodding Rob stowed the Enchanted Item in Spatial Storage Thank you he said infusing his voice with genuine gratitude Your work has been crucial towards a lot of things honestly We would ve been screwed six ways to Sunday without all those Enchanted Items and Firebombs and Potions I just want you to know that you ve made a positive difference in this world People are alive as a result of your efforts Urian responded with a loud snore Of course Rob exited the room gently shutting the door behind him to not wake the Artificer from his beauty sleep Urian Hauz Malika Diplomacy why do I know so many headstrong savants Jason and Keira too if I m including physical savants Is it me Is there something about me that attracts weirdos He was glad that no one was around to answer that question Tomorrow came in the blink of an eye The Deadlands Squad stood ready as the teleportation mages prepared to transport everyone south They d gathered their supplies their resolve and their wits The rest would come down to providence and a proper application of heavy explosives Mana began to coalesce around them In that moment Rob felt overcome by a strange sensation he couldn t quite place Something like bitter wistfulness Or maybe it was closer to a premonition Like an insistent notion that this would be the last time he saw Fiend territory He wasn t sure why This was hardly the first instance of Riardin s Rangers heading off into certain danger They d nearly been killed by Blights in what six territories now The Deadlands wasn t special just because it happened to be Elatra s version of New Jersey A little poisonous air and hostile creatures never hurt anybody Rob told himself that expecting the premonition to fade It didn t The sensation blossomed into full blown paranoia the kind that had warned him of mortal peril on far too many occasions It was right more often than not Oh well Rob thought with a mental shrug Wasn t like he could turn back even if he wanted to And if his gut was telling him that he was making a mistake He would just have to prove it wrong amp x B amp x

a little lonely and insecure as a result That insecurity didn t stop me from opting for a semester abroad It s something I d always seen as a valuable learning opportunity and thanks to my school s strong ties with a Danish educational program I soon found myself on a plane from the states to Copenhagen The first couple weeks went smoothly enough I explored plenty of landmarks from ascending the Round Tower s iconic helical corridor to touring the gigantic Frederiksborg Castle I also made progress in a basic level Danish language course Learning the language in detail was hardly necessary though as virtually every resident there would rather practice their English than try to decipher a foreigner s rudimentary Danish I first saw her at a crowded bar on a Saturday night My roommate and I were sipping Carlsbergs when I spotted a woman by the door She had red hair and pale skin and there was a peculiar kinetic energy about her that caused her to stand out from the crowd For a moment we made eye contact before nervously I averted my gaze to the floor My roommate announced that he was turning in for the night No sooner did he leave than she approached me When I started mumbling a basic greeting in Danish she smiled and quickly cut me off I saw you looking at me Want to buy me a drink Like many Danes she spoke fluent English with a Nordic accent Uh yeah sure I said gesturing for another beer on tap She introduced herself as Madeline and at her suggestion we got ourselves a small table She asked me a lot of questions and she seemed to listen intently to my responses We talked at first about basic subjects such as my hometown and my reasons for studying abroad and how she d grown up nearby but recently returned from traveling through Switzerland and Germany Before long we were discussing more personal topics I explained how my father had passed when I was little and she shared how she d recently broken up with a longtime boyfriend As our conversation stretched into the early morning I realized that I felt more comfortable around her than I did around well just about anybody else I found her extremely attractive too which contributed to my excitement Eventually she suggested that we depart You going to drink that I asked motioning to the still full beer I d ordered for her No she laughed I don t really drink I just wanted to see if you d order it for me Help yourself to it if you want I took a deep gulp from it as I left payment on the table before following her to the deserted cobblestone street outside She learned into me until her face was just inches from mine You ever kissed a girl before she whispered Yeah I lied embarrassed over my inexperience Ever done more than that Uh huh The smirk on her face showed me that she likely didn t believe me Just a little I added If she sensed I was lying it didn t seem to bother her What do you say she said drawing away from me you hang out with me tomorrow night I m having a gathering with some friends and family Afterwards we can spend some time together alone Just the two of us The wink she gave me made my heart flutter Oh yeah okay I stammered nervously Sure I ll be there That seemed to please her She proceeded to describe the route I would need to take to get there I typed each step into my travel flip phone As we parted ways she called to me Vi ses senere Danish for see you later I practically skipped with joy as I made my way home After so many self doubts and restless nights a charming gorgeous woman had shown interest in me of all people My mind flooded with thoughts of what was to follow Maybe the event would be awkward and little would come of it Perhaps I d say or do something foolish like I had so many times before and I d never hear from her again But just maybe this could be the start of something meaningful or at a minimum something validating and fun When I got home I realized that she d left me with relatively little specific information Madeline hadn t given me her last name or even her phone number I had an address but I had no idea what sort of building I was looking for or the kind of neighborhood I d be heading into Her mention of family struck me as strange too Who brings someone to a family event on a first or if last night counted second date My mind didn t dwell on these peculiarities for long Instead I replayed the wink she gave me when she d referenced us being alone together It was more than enough to silence any uncertainties I spent the next morning preparing I showered shaved my face and picked out a nice shirt I tried to think in advance of the questions her friends and family members might ask me and practiced my responses before a mirror My roommate sensing my purpose wished me luck as I stepped outside At first the journey was unremarkable The metro station had its usual glossy spotless appearance When the fully automated train arrived I took a seat near a chatty group of teens and numerous passengers embarked and departed over the next few stops Things started to change when I reached the N rreport station According to Madeline s instructions I needed to switch to a train on the silver line However I couldn t find a platform for such a line nor did one appear on any of the maps throughout the station I spotted two metro employees and asked them for assistance They exchanged a quick glance when I mentioned the silver line Are you sure you want to go there asked the first I nodded trying to make sense of their grim concerned expressions Then follow me ordered the other a short well built woman with a gray ponytail She led me up a small staircase that I otherwise would have assumed connected to a custodial closet or maintenance hatch At the top she led me down a shadowy corridor In contrast to the polished pristine look of the rest of the station the walls and flooring in this area were rugged and dirty We stepped into a cavernous room A weak flickering overhead light partially illuminated an empty train platform in its center A large sign above it read S lv Silver In contrast to the other platforms there appeared to be no ticket booth or electronic indicator of when the next train would arrive When I asked about this I found to my surprise that the woman who had brought me there was already gone I was alone I considered leaving This all made little sense the absence of any silver line from the map the platform s dingy appearance and the reaction of the employees The air had a rancid foul smell to it too and the temperature was much higher than in the rest of the station But I d come this far and it had all accorded more or less with the instructions Madeline had left me I reminded myself too of why I was there in the first place I thought about how comfortable and warm her presence had made me feel last night I imagined the smile that would spread across her face when she saw me the feeling of her lips pressed against mine doing more than kissing perhaps even quite a bit more Eventually two harsh red lights punctured the opaque darkness and approached like the eyes of a hunting predator As they grew closer I discerned that they were the headlights to an older shabbier train than the one I d used to get here The smudges across its glass windows and the graffiti that covered its metal exterior reminded me much more of public transportation in the U S than what I d seen elsewhere in Copenhagen Even though the train seemed to be at the end of the line no one who had arrived on it exited Instead the handful of passengers in the car I stepped onto remained eerily silent as I took a seat An empty glass bottle rolled across its dusty floor as the train jutted back into motion reversing direction into the black void from which it had emerged I checked the directions Madeline had given me Seven metro stops and then a five block walk until I reached Skeltoftevej I d be there soon enough I tried to relax as the train sputtered along At the first two stops no one got on or off By the time the train approached the third stop I noticed a peculiar stillness among the passengers in my periphery Neither the lanky man by the door nor the mother and daughter in matching red jackets in the seats ahead of me had moved an inch since I d gotten onboard As far as I could tell everyone around me remained completely motionless I shifted my gaze to the window on my right as the train approached the third stop Between the back glare against the dirty glass and the outside platform s minimal lighting I could barely make anything out The doors opened and again I discerned no movement onto or off of the train Staring deep into the shadows outside I noticed something else odd the vague outlines of figures all as still as those in my train car At the fourth station I observed the same thing I couldn t identify any details of the distant spectators beyond that they just seemed to be standing there doing nothing at all It perplexed me Why were they there As far as I could tell there wasn t any other train on this track As the train departed I picked up on another detail pairs of tiny neon green dots of light They were hard to make out at first but once I noticed them I couldn t ignore them Each hovered above the ground right around where the obscured figures faces would be The fifth and sixth stops were the same Now that I knew to look for them I detected no fewer than a dozen pairs of these glowing lights all gazing at the train like eyes that never blinked As we approached the seventh stop I wasn t sure what to make of what I d been seeing The distant figures spooked me even though I had no reason to think I was in any danger I reflected on just how alone and isolated I was After all I was a foreigner traveling to an area I knew nothing about on a line that didn t appear on maps all to see someone I d only just met I hadn t even told anyone where I was going But I had to exit the train at some point even if only to turn around So I mustered my courage and approached the screen doors praying that whatever lay in the void ahead of me meant me no harm and that I d soon be happily reunited with the gorgeous woman who d shown so much interest in me As the doors began to open my hands shot impulsively to my eyes to protect them from an unexpected and intense wave of what felt like blisteringly bright light As my eyes started to adjust I squinted to find before me a fully illuminated train platform To my relief it was bereft of any skulking figures or anyone at all for that matter Sounds of my footsteps echoed through the vacant train station as I made my way through it There was nothing odd about its structure or layout but the absence of other people left me uneasy I remembered the giggling teens and hand holding couples I was used to seeing at places like this Everything around me by contrast felt artificial mechanical and joyless The street outside had a similarly ethereal aura to it It possessed all the qualities of the vibrant cityscape I d spent the last few weeks exploring cobblestone streets occasional baroque churches crooked houses painted in warm hues of yellow red and orange but it was all quiet so quiet and the air carried a suffocating staleness As I passed by a restaurant I found myself fixating on its chairs and tables all uninhabited like everything else around me Their design and the layout in general were identical to that of an upscale Italian place not far from my dorm back in the states My mind flashed back to the night I d taken Audrie a girl from my chemistry class out on a date Our conversation over the meal had been awkward She d acted friendly towards me earlier but that night she d been guarded and withholding When the check arrived I d tried to pay it in full but she d insisted on splitting the expense As we stepped outside she confessed that she d thought we were hanging out as friends and hadn t realized until she d arrived at the restaurant that I d asked her on a date I m sorry I didn t say something earlier I just didn t know what to do When she told me she didn t see me that way I said that was okay and I d apologized for the misunderstanding I felt terrible though I tried not to show it I dismissed the memory quickly As I continued towards Madeline s address a distant noise caught my attention As I got closer I recognized it as laughter At first I found this reassuring It was the first sign of life I d encountered after traversing so much seemingly abandoned cityscape But I steadily pick up on an unwelcome undertone to the shrill giggles ahead of me There was a piercing meanness to them They recalled the specter of a group of people young people by the sound of it basking in a peer s humiliation It was a sound I knew too well When I d summoned my courage to ask a classmate out to prom a fellow violist named Maria I d shared a stand with in orchestra for over a year she d laughed at me like that and her friends had quickly joined in Do better I d told myself when I d cried into the mirror that night Nobody owes me anything I d do better tonight I told myself Everything was going to change Madeline and I had made a connection so quickly She really liked me and I liked her too Maybe I d just grown up on the wrong continent The laughter got louder until right as I reached the alley from which it seemed to have been emanating it stopped and there was no one there to be found Just keep moving I told myself adding it to a list of abnormalities I fought to keep buried in the back of my mind I m almost there Finally I reached a street sign that read Skeltoftevej The first few buildings were businesses a deli that served distinctly Danish open sandwiches called sm rrebr d a barber s shop a camera store At last I found myself facing a brick structure with the number affixed to its front door The sign next to the entrance displayed three words Den V rdige Bedemand I knew that den translated to the but the remaining words were unfamiliar to me My best guess was that it was a bar or a restaurant If so it was a fancy one judging by the black suit worn by the man by the ornate front desk inside incidentally the first person I d seen since the train station I expected to feel some sense of relief at seeing another living breathing person but his emaciated appearance and grim expression brought me little comfort He said something to me in Danish I think Lan jeg hj lpe dig Can I help you but he spoke a little too rapidly for me to be sure I just stated Madeline s name hoping he d understand that I was looking for her Madeline he repeated back to me He nodded solemnly and then beckoned for me to follow him We arrived in a large plain room occupied by at least two dozen people The first thing I noticed about them was how formally they were dressed My patterned button down shirt looked outright casual compared to the suit jackets and plain dresses all muted shades of black and gray worn by everyone else Naturally I felt out of place Nobody said anything to me but I sensed truthfully or not that I was being judged Why hadn t Madeline told me this was a fancy event I wondered too Where was Madeline what kind of event had she invited me to The absence of any food or silverware laden tables confirmed that I was not in fact in a restaurant as I d inferred Rather the attendees were standing and chatting quietly with each other in voices no louder than a whisper Nobody really seemed to be doing anything in particular I approached an elderly man standing alone Excuse me I said meekly I m looking for Madeline A puzzled expression formed on his face As he looked me over skeptically my face turned red with a mix of nervousness and embarrassment I felt so hopelessly lost and confused He slowly raised his arm and pointed towards the far end of the room Tak I muttered before nudging my way through the small crowd in the direction he had indicated My jaw nearly dropped when I saw the wooden casket which was decorated by an array of lilies and roses Madeline lay underneath its open head panel Her eyes were closed and she was perfectly still She wore the same clothes I d seen her in the previous night A display next to the casket read Madeline H nning december september It was too much to take in My legs grew weak and I began feeling dizzy My mind raced to process what was happening I was at a funeral home And Madeline had invited me to her own open casket Something else stuck out to me Last night when I d met Madeline was September th One week after the date listed as that of her death None of this made sense What was I doing here How was any of this possible The old man who d directed me shuffled past me and stood next to the casket He turned to face the rest of the crowd which quickly grew silent I realized he was giving some kind of speech Was he a relative or a priest perhaps He spoke in a coarse raspy voice My mind was too astounded for me to grasp a word of what he was saying I wasn t even sure that it was Danish The reaction from the crowd baffled me even more They were laughing Again and again the man made comments comments that I could not understand and the rest of the room chortled and giggled in response All I could do was watch embarrassed and dumbfounded as I wondered who tells jokes at an occasion like this Suddenly all eyes turned to me Michael the man hissed somehow knowing my name It s time Time for what I replied exasperated I looked around the room at the dozens of people staring intently at me What s happening What do you want from me It s not us who want you said the man It s her He walked up to me then turned to face the casket I stood frozen as Madeline s corpse sat up Madeline opened her eyes and placing both hands on the casket s mahogany surface pulled herself slowly upward and hopped onto the floor Michael she said her voice weaker and coarser than it had been last night You came I knew you would She wobbled towards me her legs seemingly straining to support her I froze unable to comprehend what I was seeing Are you are you I stuttered They re going to bury me Michael she said as she continued her approach Six feet under As she got closer I recoiled at her rank putrid smell Impulsively I backed up only for the speaker to grip me tightly holding me in place I don t want to be alone Michael said Madeline There s room for us both down there No I gasped as I struggled to get free No please There s so much that I can show you It ll be just the two of us and we ll have all the time in the world Isn t this what you always wanted To never be alone again She stood right in front of me now My stomach churned as the rotting smell grew even more pungent The world spun around me as panic set in I remember tearing the man s hands off me losing my balance and slamming my head painfully into the casket before I hit the ground When I came to my head was throbbing and I was being dragged outside by two men Graves littered the surrounding landscape A crowd of people including Madeline had assembled by a deep pit a short distance away from me Next to it was a coffin a much larger one than I d ever seen before Large enough for two bodies I couldn t make sense of anything that was happening But I knew with a sense of absolute certainty that I was about to be buried there I figured my best bet would be to act before they realized I was awake Throwing all my force into it I lunged forward managing barely to pull myself free One of the men dived for me grabbing my leg and sending me toppling over a headstone As I scrambled to my feet I noticed a long metal shovel laying atop a pile of dirt As one of the men charged at me I picked up the shovel and frantically swung it The blade slammed into his cheek sending him sprawling Michael what are you doing cried Madeline I didn t respond My attention was fixed on the man I d just hit The force of the blow had somehow fractured his skin Cracks spread over his face which then shattered into small pieces that fell onto the ground revealing the raw bones of his skull and a pair of unblinking unnaturally bright green eyes As he got to his feet seemingly unbothered by the evisceration of his face my flight instinct kicked in I remember climbing a fence and ignoring the pain in my ankle when I hit the ground on the other side I remember the sounds of dozens of footsteps pursuing me and being too afraid to look back I remember Madeline s voice begging me to return I ran on instinct retracing my steps as best I could Figures filled the once deserted streets around me I ignored their missing faces and the green glow they emitted I ignored the ones who called for me who said they wanted me who resembled Audrie Maria and so many others whose rejection haunted my mind every time I closed my eyes at night By the time I reached the platform I was breathing rapidly and drenched in sweat Thankfully a train was already there I could hear voices resounding through the station behind me They were getting closer louder by the moment I could tell that the train s doors were about to close With my last bit of strength I dashed forward and dove between them Pain shot through me as my body thudded onto the hard surface inside When I awoke my body ached all over I was laying on a couch in some kind of office and a woman I recognized as the employee who had led me to the silver line stood over me Did you find what you were looking for she asked I was too perplexed to answer What where am I My office at the N rreport station Just upstairs from where you started I don t understand She shrugged You do not have to You should go home But but I stammered What about the silver line and things I saw Nobody will be riding the silver line anytime soon Just closed down for repairs Go home I ve never fully understood what happened to me that day The metro employee refused to answer any more of my questions I never saw her again or any mention of a silver line even existing Nor could I find any reference in an atlas to the part of town it had brought me to Once before returning to the states I ran into the bartender who d been on duty when I d met Madeline When I asked him what he remembered about that night he responded that he recalled me sitting alone talking to myself for hours We did have a regular customer with that name he d continued after I mentioned Madeline s full name She told me once that we were her favorite bar in town Haven t seen her in months though I have no idea what happened to her My physical wounds bruises and a sprained ankle healed relatively quickly but inside I felt shattered I became reclusive focusing entirely on my studies and after graduating on my work A few weeks ago my brother set me up on a date with a friend of a friend who he insisted was a good fit for me Understandably I d spent the last few years utterly detached from the dating scene and avoiding any perceived advances But I eventually caved in to my brother s persistence Her name is Clara and well my brother was right She and I formed an instant connection and so far we seem to be a perfect match for each other The other night we even exchanged a kiss the first of my life We were sitting together in my apartment s living room on a rainy Saturday afternoon when I heard a knock at the door I opened it to find a bouquet of lilies and roses sitting on the doormat Did you order these I asked Clara She shook her head her expression puzzled and concerned A small card pinned to the bouquet displayed a short handwritten message in black ink Death is the great equalizer Michael When it comes for you too know one thing I will be waiting Vi ses senere Madeline X https www reddit com r PeaceSim"

        "cleaned_text": "One thing I ve noticed with the PR effort and likely by extension the policy thinking around new MRT lines opening is that they seem to be targeted at car owners and people who would drive Have you seen the posters Give your car a break take TEL Has it worked Nope For every dollar the LTA spends on TEL operations it makes less than cents If you count only the service fees paid to SMRT it s better but only cents SBST management has also gone on the record https www sbstransit com sg Uploads Investor Relations AGM sbst agm minutes pdf that their break even point for DTL is k far higher than the LTA s ridership estimates of k That it still produces losses https www mot gov sg news Details oral reply by acting minister for transport chee hong tat to parliamentary question on keeping public transport fares affordable in the rail side despite operating the cash cow NEL points to a policy failure The high use of public transport in Singapore and the recent astronomical COE prices makes it very difficult to get more people to give up their cars Just look at all the new parents who insist they need a car to bring the little ones out on the weekends Consequently if there is diminishing returns from converting car owners the LTA should shift their focus to primarily targeting public transport users It controls more of this experience as central bus planner under bus contracting it should be the LTA s job to redesign local bus networks to drive more inter regional trips to the MRT system Furthermore since new lines like TEL and CRL are being built to relieve overpressure sections of the existing MRT network MRT passengers also need a push factor to take the new lines TEL waiting times may be that long because there s not enough passengers to use it so if you want shorter waiting times you should support steps taken to increase ridership Firstly long milk run routes like are less reliable and since waiting time is a KPI bus operators are forced to increase travel times along these routes which means added cost in order to provide space to cushion the impact of traffic and meet their waiting time KPIs We ve all seen and complained about bus bunching Breaking these long routes to reduce bus travel time should happen Secondly in the north and soon east reconsider the regional relevance of the City Direct system and other similar services E E E etc travelling on expressways to the CBD during peak periods Peak period expressway congestion results in longer travel time compared to the off peak ideal which means bus companies again have to devote more resources to ensure a consistent waiting time and punctual departures By shifting these to the MRT system bus resources can be conserved to improve intratown and short distance travel Thirdly there must be consideration on beefing up local services to better connect people to new lines It took five years to provide a DTL connection to residents of Bedok North Ave with the amendment of Service only done in This ignorance of MRT connections still exists with the new Service B https www sbstransit com sg news introduction of service b literally ending one stop short of Lentor MRT This means that there is no additional capacity or reason for Sengkang residents to use the TEL to avoid the NEL Fourthly travel times Traffic congestion is not caused only by cars it can be caused by buses too Both have to be counted and not just during the off peak ideal Bus only systems in other cities also suffer from the same problems and that s why Ong Teng Cheong pushed to have the MRT built There is space to optimize the MRT service and it should be taken Similarly a more compact bus network can provide shorter intervals between buses using the same manpower resources Bus passengers who don t touch the MRT such as seniors and students travelling within a HDB town can also benefit from this Lastly all of us must also realize that there are other factors such as reliability and punctuality which the MRT can do better and as Singapore s workforce shrinks and labor costs increase automated MRT lines are the solution to managing these costs In contrast new bus depots under construction even contain foreign worker dorms indicating that the LTA foresees we will still need to import foreign bus drivers en masse The buses or so in storage pale in comparison to the billions of dollars spent on MRT lines that so far remain underused The DTL costs billion the TEL billion and that s before operating subsidies paid out to keep the lines afloat We are opening new MRT lines every year until and if they don t learn this lesson now they may be bleeding out on the CRL with CRL designed more for relieving the existing network than providing new access Ottawa even had to break their bus only system replacing it with a train A majority of bus services were cut back to the train terminals instead of going to downtown Ottawa and they re a much smaller city than us Planned extensions to the Ottawa O Train also include pushing the bus terminals further back into line extensions to split them up and prevent them from congesting a given terminal Opening a new rail line every year literally means we need to do something like this every year but that is not happening The expectation of build it and the car drivers will come which served us well during the NSEWL and perhaps NEL years is no longer relevant all the more so when bus companies were able to see the impact of the coming MRT then and adapt their networks accordingly Now you wonder why transport ministers keep talking about sustainability but so far it seems to be all talk and no action If MOT wants to cut public transport costs this is where it should start by recognizing the impact of the MRT early and taking proactive steps to manage it There s probably more than years worth of adaptation to be made"

when they analysed the stock performance of the top companies for stressfree satisfication happinness and purpose individually Based on literature the study discussed potential reasons for these results productivity relationships creativity health recruitment and retention The discussion is long so see the study for the full discussion and supporting evidence For a very brief summary Employee wellbeing was linked to employee performance Employees with higher wellbeing worked faster more efficiently and more effectively Happier employees developed more supportive relationships with colleagues and supervisors demonstrated higher capacities for cooperation and collaboration had more satisfied and loyal customer and were better negotiators A wide body of research demonstrated the importance of wellbeing in promoting creativity generally defined as the production of novel and useful ideas Happier people had greater mental flexibility and broader awareness thereby enabling them to make sparse connections and generate original ideas There was a very strong relationship between wellbeing and health Poor physical and mental health was linked to reduced work performance primarily due to higher rates of absenteeism and presenteeism Employees with low job satisfaction have been found to be more likely to leave work early arrive at work late and miss days of work entirely Jobseekers valued employee wellbeing and avoided firms with poor wellbeing which impacted the ability of firms to attract talent A study examined the effects of randomly exposing job seekers to information about company happiness levels on Indeed The experiment involved more than million job seekers in the United States United Kingdom and Canada and found that job seekers responded behaviorally to this information by redirecting their applications away from low happiness companies to happier ones Much of this effect was driven by job seekers screening out low happiness firms from their job search In follow up analyses the study found that by improving their score companies could attract more applications from people viewing the company on the platform There was a negative relationship between employee wellbeing and turnover High employee wellbeing predicted lower rates of turnover Turnover was costly for firms Estimates of organizational costs associated with turnover from the United States Department of Labor ranged from one half to five times of the workers original annual salary Some of these costs were due to lost productivity rehiring retraining and loss of skill and knowledge The annual turnover separation rates in and were In Gallup estimated US businesses were losing trillion annually due to voluntary turnover The study cited multiple studies for each point but they only scratched the surface There was a very large amount of literature on employee wellbeing which basically all supported the relationship between employee wellbeing productivity

        "cleaned_text": "Introduction As a child Doumar s was a staple of downtown Norfolk Virginia It wasn t a place I d get to frequent often but I still have clear and fond memories of stopping by the place after a school field trip For whatever reason the thing I remember most vividly is their lime sherbet A vibrant neon green scoop sat nestled upon a classic and unassuming waffle cone The tart flavor of the sherbet somehow perfectly matched its bold coloration sending a shockwave through my tastebuds However it s not the sherbet itself that forms the basis of my piece today but it s throne For that classic and unassuming waffle cone is surprisingly the center of much contention This is because Doumar s founder Abe Doumar claimed to have created the first waffle cone way back at the St Louis World s Fair of In fact this claim is doubled down upon with a sign that hangs in the little drive in stating This is the world s first cone machine still in use today it was used in at Coney Island N Y by Abe Doumar inventor of the ice cream cone amp this machine It s a cool piece of hometown trivia and a source of local pride to have such a neat historical tidbit in one s backyard and for many years I never questioned it That is until the summer of when during a tour of Budweiser in St Louis the tour guide related a fun fact that caught me a bit off guard Pointing to an ornate chandelier adorned with carefully crafted hop ornamentation she mentioned that the antique dated back to the St Louis World s Fair an event associated with a wide variety of technological and scientific developments among them the invention of the ice cream cone which would go on to become Missouri s official state dessert as a result all the way in Local pride swelled within me and I felt determined to go home and research the invention of the ice cream cone hoping to defend the name of Abe Doumar What I found was one of the most complex stories surrounding one of the simplest little inventions So strap in and get ready to journey down the rabbit hole with me into the mysterious origins of the ice cream cone and more specifically the waffle cone This journey will take us back into ancient history then into the present where we ll discuss what in the world a World s Fair is before investigating several claims regarding the origins of the waffle cone The History of the Ice Cream Cone The tour guide that day was unfortunately wrong Or rather she was over simplifying I can t be too hard on her for it After all most people don t want an over long lecture on the nuances involved in the invention of the ice cream cone well except for the lovely folks reading this of course And it feels much more significant to say that one created the ice cream cone rather than saying that one created a sub genre of ice cream cone that they may or may not have even created in the first place It would have been far more accurate to say that the waffle cone was created at the St Louis World s Fair as this is what we seemingly have evidence of Conversely we have evidence of ice cream cones albeit in many diverse forms dating back thousands of years Food journalist Laura B Weiss suggests that ancient Greeks and Romans rolled and baked wafers that may have acted as a precursor to the modern ice cream cone However these wafers likely were not used for dessert purposes In French painter and engraver Philibert Louis Debucourt created an etching known as The Interior of the Caf Frascati a piece that shows great talent but that like most of his other works was primarily focused on the cavorting upper classes However what makes this work of art particularly interesting is a woman in the right bottom corner who appears to be holding a conic dessert of some sort Some scholars have suggested that this is the first pictorial representation of an ice cream cone thereby suggesting that the treat dates back to the early th century While I believe that the woman certainly seems to be holding a sort of dessert cone I m not sure I feel comfortable saying whether it s an ice cream cone or not I think it s just as likely to be a similar conic dessert like one of the ones that we ll cover next I think that we re more likely to see an ice cream cone because we re so familiar with them but I m concerned by the lack of any corroborating evidence in this era That being said only years later in a recipe explaining how to roll little waffles into cones appeared in the cookbook of French chef Julien Archambault I actually tracked down an original copy of the cookbook and found the page cited p but my French knowledge has always been let s just say better than that of the general American public but not by much at all I perused his section on dessert pastries but it is a text heavy rather than list based cookbook so I wasn t able to intuit much The only dessert pastry directly on p suggests serving with cheese and some of the later pastries seem to suggest serving with fruit or other cheeses though nothing really close to ice cream as far as I can tell Feel free to correct me in the comments actual French speakers Then in Italian British chef Charles Elme Francatelli referenced using cones as an accoutrement to larger deserts in his cookbook The Modern Chef Again I was able to track down the original cookbook this time with much more success and not just because it was printed in English Francatelli as early as p references the use of cornets of cornucopiae filled with a little of the vanilla ice cream as part of a larger recipe for an Iced Pudding a la Cerito Still these cornets of cornucopiae had not caught on as the hip way to serve ice cream to the masses at least not yet Nonetheless th century ice cream vendors needed something to give their customers their ice cream in as the sweet treat had only become more popular over the course of the century Sadly germ theory did not catch on with quite the same fanfare as ice cream did and most vendors chose to dole out ice cream in penny licks little glass bowls purposefully designed to make it look like one was getting more ice cream than one actually was and that worst of all were meant to be reused typically without washing In a scientific study blamed penny licks for a recent and deadly outbreak of cholera in the city of London Given just how prevalent cholera was in this era in urban England it s hard to tell whether it was actually the fault of the penny licks but they almost certainly couldn t have helped They were soon banned in the city In the s an alternative to ice cream arrived in the form of the hokey pokey the creation of Italian immigrants in London The hokey pokey was a mixture of coarse ice milk water sugar and cornstarch frozen then wrapped in paper and sold to the customer When its inventors brought it to the United States within a few years local newspaper lauded it for its portability cleanliness and convenience Clearly people wanted something that could hold their sweet treats and be easily disposed of afterwards with little to no mess or inconvenience Ice cream vendors certainly experimented with other methods such as wafer ice cream sandwiches and molds that shaped wafers into edible bowls In English cook Agnes B Marshall published a recipe for Cornets with Cream in her cookbook Mrs A B Marshall s Book of Cookery that called for making the cornets out of almonds and baking them in the oven rather than pressing them Many sources refer to Marshall as the inventor of the modern ice cream cone but I m at a bit of a loss as to why considering her recipe seems no closer to the modern ice cream cone than her predecessors Personally I m of the mind that we either need to go further back than this to declare an inventor of the original ice cream cone or go further ahead to where the ice cream cone actually begins to look like a modern ice cream cone which is just a few years later at the St Louis World s Fair The St Louis World s Fair Many of us who run in true crime circles are most familiar with the idea of the world s fair are most familiar with the Chicago World s Fair also known as the World s Columbian Exposition Because of the magnificent architecture numerous innovations and the proximity of early American serial killer H H Holmes the Exposition has rightly warranted much consideration perhaps most famously in Erik Larson s fascinating and fantastic book The Devil in the White City However the St Louis World s Fair also known as the Louisiana Purchase Exposition similarly helped transform America s identity as it headed from a th century that had been generally isolationist into a th century where it would become a global superpower with its own unique form of empire This new American imperialism was showcased in the Exposition s most controversial and uncomfortable inclusion human beings on display The United States had begun non contiguous expansion in the wake of the Spanish American War of through which the United States acquired the territories of Guam Puerto Rico and the Philippines The Philippines in particular had fought back against American annexation The Philippine Revolution had actually begun not against American rule but against Spanish rule in After the Spanish American War ended with Spain ceding the Philippines the American government refused to acknowledge the Filipino declaration of independence leading to the Philippine American War from The war was bloody and gruesome killing several thousand American soldiers over ten thousand Filipino revolutionaries and resulting in the death of over Filipino civilians mostly as a result of conditions created by the war notably starvation and disease And yet just two short years later here were Filipinos on display as an exhibit at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition Some of the Filipinos brought in for the Exposition died to the absurdly harsh conditions they were put through Traditional burial practices were denied Across the fair attendees marveled at the seeming magic of wireless telephones and a new medical scanning technology called an x ray Within the Palace of Transportation they were wowed by personal gas powered automobiles they would be able to own their own sooner than they likely realized People could get around on an electric streetcar which was still relatively new and came to the fair to see the benefits of a more electric future They could observe premature infants in infant incubators which weren t necessarily new but weren t widely accepted By bringing these incubators to several World s Fairs their creators helped people see the vital nature of these devices which likely led to many young lives being saved in the years to come My point in highlighting this is to give you a sense of the reality and the duality of these World s Fairs I feel like it s something we can t properly conceive of because they eventually faded away no longer a huge draw for American and international audiences Additionally such World s Fairs would have become increasingly awkward following the atrocities that marked the early th century But my point is that these World s Fairs were a theatre in which to showcase the wonderful and the terrible Larson makes similar points in The Devil in the White City but I think it s even more pronounced at the St Louis World s Fair because the wonderful and the terrible co existed within the official confines of the fair itself One could see the wonders of modern medicine and technology then turn a corner and see a human zoo a zoo that was far more concerned with entertainment than with cultural accuracy and that completely objectified its inhabitants one of which a Congolese Pygmy was later featured in an exhibit on evolution alongside an orangutan a crass display that was thankfully shut down due to protest I m sure that plenty won t care for this aside given its seeming lack of relevance to the original topic but I think it s worth stopping for a minute to examine what a World s Fair is warts and all before simply singing the praises of an invention that sprung from it It s important at least to me to contextualize the environments in which these events take place The Invention of the Waffle Cone The story behind the waffle cone s creation is actually rather simple and perhaps a tad bit too convenient At the St Louis World s Fair an ice cream vendor runs out of paper cups in which to sell his ice cream Nearby another vendor usually a Syrian immigrant sees a business opportunity Rolling a thin waffle cookie I ve seen some sources say zalabia which doesn t feel right based on the images of zalabia I ve seen into a conic shape the vendor plopped a scoop of ice cream on top and the waffle cone was born We in fact have proof that the waffle cone was indeed at the St Louis World s Fair Several photographs of different families eating ice cream out of waffle cones exist around the internet and within the Missouri State Archives Additionally the St Louis Daily Globe Democrat ran an article praising the cones linked below While they call the cone an ice cream sandwich their description along with an illustration of the sandwich make it clear that they re referring to the waffle cone The problem is that we don t know what vendor anybody got their waffle cones from and that s where things start to get real messy You see it s not even clear whether the famous story is even true Was the waffle cone truly born from a moment of desperation If so the two vendors must have mastered the art of the waffle cone rather quickly as those in surviving photos from the fair look pristine Alternatively others have proposed that the waffle cone was a vendor s way of getting a leg up in a highly competitive battle for concessionaire spots at the fair However if the classic story proves to be true there are multiple claimants to actually inventing the waffle cone Perhaps the best known is Ernest Hamwi who claims that he was the Syrian immigrant running the waffle cookie stand that originally rolled the first waffle cone Albert and Nick Kabbaz also Syrian immigrants would later claim that they were working for Hamwi that day and originally had the idea to roll up a waffle into a cone which Hamwi then stole from them Arnold Fornachou and David Avayou have both also made dubious claims to being the Syrian immigrant vendor themselves Abe Doumar progenitor of the Norfolk based drive in mentioned in my introduction has a slightly different claim According to the Doumar s website Abe who is also a Syrian immigrant claims to have simply been in the right place at the right time He says he was there when the ice cream vendor ran out of cups bought a waffle rolled it himself then asked for a scoop of ice cream plopped on top of it Though there is evidence that Doumar was running a four iron cone press just a year later in Coney Island and even though he and his legacy have established a local favorite based around this origin story I have to admit that Doumar s claims are specious at best If you go to the Doumar s website you ll see that Doumar claims to have spent the rest of that summer selling ice cream in waffle cones How did Doumar go from patron or vendor of unspecified wares to ice cream and cone proprietor in no time at all Given how fiercely others had to fight to get a concessions slot at the St Louis World s Fair I question whether this would have even been possible At the end of the day as much as I hate to say it the evidence points to the Doumar s story being fabricated My personal guess is that Abe Doumar was indeed there that summer He saw a stand selling the waffle cones and being a bright young entrepreneur brainstormed the idea for a four iron cone maker that would allow him to roll one cone while three more cooked then brought that idea to various tourist destinations across the east coast before settling in Norfolk Or the stand at the World s Fair already had four irons and he just stole that too I m not really sure to be completely honest Quite interestingly the Library of Congress identifies someone else entirely as the progenitor of the waffle cone Perhaps the only claimant who wasn t a Syrian immigrant Charles E Menches claimed to be the waffle cookie vendor on that fateful day at the St Louis World s Fair and asserted that it was he and his brother Frank s idea to place his ice cream into the rolled waffle cookies So how do we make sense of these various claims almost all of them bullishly asserting their claim without evidence to support it Chasing the Ameri Cone Dream Let s revisit the idea of the human zoo As discussed above these human zoos were not particularly interested in providing a factual representation of the peoples they put on display Rather they engaged in a form of myth making that relied heavily on stereotype providing a narrative that was meant to draw people in and amaze them rather than educate them The benefactors of these zoos knew that they were highly unlikely to attract customers with the truth so they spun a fiction that would be far more attractive and fascinating to their clientele And it worked the human zoos were highly popular I think we see an interesting parallel here with our plethora of alleged waffle cone inventors Because without their various stories of inventing the waffle cone at the St Louis World s Fair what did they have Immigrant owned businesses fighting an uphill battle to make it to achieve their own version of the American Dream Was it dishonest Certainly But in a nation that was more than happy to spin all sorts of false narratives about them why not turn it around and create a false narrative around oneself Was it effective I don t think there s any doubting that it was With a narrative that put their businesses at the center of history these immigrants had a powerful draw Perhaps more indicative of this than anything is that some of these businesses have survived to the modern day where countless similar businesses have failed But it s evident too in just how heavily these businesses market their claim to fame Doumar s claims A History as Rich as Our Custom Made Ice Cream on their website clicking on it takes you to Abe Doumar s epic story of inventing the waffle cone Menches Brothers claims This is a taste of history It s more difficult to find their claim to inventing the waffle cone on their website as they tend to prioritize their supposed invention of the hamburger instead Perhaps most damning to all these claims is that most of them didn t become public until almost a decade after the St Louis World s Fair While it s clear from photographs that waffle cones were at the World s Fair no one seems to have made an immediate claim to inventing the cone afterwards which one would expect if it truly came about in the ingenious manner that is so often recounted Is it possible that one of these men truly did invent the waffle cone at the World s Fair and simply didn t go public with their claims for nearly a full decade Sure but I don t think it s particularly likely What I find far more likely is the possibility that the lack of a claimant created a mysterious void that was perfect for clever entrepreneurs to spin to their own benefit Frankly I think that what most likely happened is that none of these men invented the waffle cone I think it was likely a brilliant way to get around the need for cups and thus additional waste or the spreading of germs that simply wasn t immediately claimed or patented The invention of the waffle cone is likely far more mundane than we ve been led to believe after over a century of fantastical stories of human ingenuity but the truth is none of these stories add up None of them add up at least until we begin to consider what these entrepreneurs gained They had a product to sell and the story of the waffle cone made that product so much more marketable and a far bigger draw even if admittedly the lime sherbet is pretty darn good Sources https doumars com norfolk ghent doumar s cones and barbeque history https doumars com norfolk

        "cleaned_text": "I lived in Pittsburgh from to The first year was outside of the city For the sake of this post I ll ignore that year since the outskirts of every American city is a dismal hellscape Also I only rent Weather Pittsburgh was the first place where I noticed the sky In NYC one only really thinks about the weather when it is extreme Other than that there are too many interesting things going on in the city to pay attention to that From October to April the sun disappears Turns out this is awful for someone with depression If you want grey weather but cooler the PNW is the place to go Culture Pittsburgh is a city of sports and bars By sports I mean that people watch sports I was shocked by the amount of smoking alcohol consumption and overeating Pretty much everything in the city revolves around that There are small subcultures of rock climbers dancers cyclists etc but the respective communities are tiny and overlapping NOTE if you are a climber or slackliner with an interest in proximity to West Virginia this is the place for you Any other athletic community outside of that is incredibly small Culture pt The divide between white and black people in Pittsburgh is NUTS It felt like these respective groups existed in different worlds There were also no immigrants at all It felt like stories of what the US in the s was like Many black people there were standoffish about non American black people claiming anything that isn t black American culture If you know you know In DC or NYC there were Haitians Dominicans Nigerians Ethiopians Jamaicans Trinidadians etc Lots of people in the big East Coast cities are also mixed but you never really had to explain yourself to people Public Transportation I can t fault Pittsburgh too much as most American cities are bad at this Outside of Highland Park Squirrel Hill Downtown Oakland and the like public transportation is awful Food No Beef Patties and Coco bread instant C on food Police Don t get me wrong the NYPD are terrifying but I never learned true fear of cops until I moved to Pittsburgh I was always on foot so in the event I did get stopped I was always in some gods forsaken underpopulated part of the city If anything happened to me there would be no one to film the situation and no one to advocate for me Sprinkle in the racialized politics of the city and the stage is set for some f ckery Racism Level I regret not keeping an active record of all of the wild racist shit people said to me I remember a conversation at one place where I worked If I recall correctly it was my first week and I was being trained She said some quote from some old show I can t remember which one but it was met by a blank and confused look on my part Oh you don t know that What did you grow up with Driveby shootings This person did not know me or my story yes I did grow up in really bad neighborhoods but I easily could have been a middle class kid Racism Level Turns out there are lots of racist conventions in central and western PA I had a run in with a handful of these f cks while walking alongside an exurban road Luckily they did not get out of their van I was alone a half mile from any kind of help and had they decided to do more than honking and heckling this would be a very different story Nature there are ticks everywhere This is an issue all over the East Coast outside of Maine and Vermont I think so I can t uniquely blame PA here Cost of living If you make minimum wage or near minimum wage life will still be hard At least when you are cash strapped in NYC you can find ways to live life Not being able to afford a car means you are locked out of everything outside of a handful of neighborhoods and even then it is incredibly annoying to get around Accent The Pittsburgh accent is like the Baltimore accent It was the first time when I realized that even AAVE has enough variation that mutual intelligibility can become difficult Things I liked Geography the hills ringing the center of the city are impressive There are dozens of spots where you can find breathtaking views Autumn this one speaks for itself PA is a stunning place in the autumn The City the city was built for nearly K people and currently has a population of K It made the city feel like Fallout Stalker Yharnam without the charm of Edinburgh take your pick Memories I fell in love for the first time in Pittsburgh Started my first steps to dealing my depression there as well Parkour spots The architecture of the city high levels of abandonment and the density of universities in Oakland made for some of the best Parkour spots I ve seen in the country It is a shame there weren t more people here to take advantage of it Village feel near the city center I don t remember if it was Lawrenceville but there was a cute outdoor market on the weekends There were also cute eateries that didn t cost an arm and a leg for good quality espresso and yummy pastries Proximity to NYC and DC Megabus Not sure what the prices are now but megabus prices from Pittsburgh were dirt cheap If I needed to get out of town for a while I could"

Along with the joyful news about the de occupation of Izium Slobozhanshchyna in September the whole world became aware of the following heinous crimes committed by the Russians dozens of tortured people and mass burials from which bodies were exhumed This is how the world saw Izium But over the past years the city has twice become a battlefield and some of its residents were under occupation twice in their lifetimes consequently waiting for liberation twice There still remain remnants of the bridge built by the Nazis buildings that have already survived one war and witnessed the current one and most importantly there are still people who remember it Mariia Kapanina who used to work as a teacher and librarian in schools and vividly remembers what Izium and its outskirts were like before and during WWII The woman was born and raised on a farmstead near Izium that has since been abandoned much like most such settlements years ago there were up to houses now there are about people On February Mariia celebrated her nd birthday with her family The author of this story was also born and raised in Izium It was his first trip home after the city s liberation in September He met Mariia accidentally when his friend asked him to bring her mother and grandmother a heater in Izium Mariia was very grateful for his help and was very friendly So they agreed to talk It fell to a

first ones in her life Mariia has two daughters One left the city during the occupation and the other still lives with her Their apartment is calm and quiet with only the wall clock ticking rhythmically There are selected works by the legendary Ukrainian authors Ostap Vyshnia and Taras Shevchenko on the shelf next to Mariia s armchair It s a great pity for Ukraine the woman sighs and points out that Kobzar s Shevchenko Ed poems closely resemble the present During our two hour conversation it becomes clear that Mariia is blessed with almost phenomenal memory She vividly remembers even the weather at the beginning of the Nazi occupation in and when the shooting stopped on May th gt I remember Kharkiv after the war the ruins were still everywhere In we went to clear the debris on clean up days right where the Ukraine cinema is located in Shevchenko Park now Mariia recollects the post war city In her story the words I remember sound frequently There is an age gap of about years between us Mariia s story about the two wars is elaborated with the diary of the Russian Ukrainian war kept by her daughters Natalia and Olena during the temporary occupation How the wars in Izium started In Mariia finished the th grade She lived in the village of Holubivka now almost extinct next to Izium with her grandparents She heard about the beginning of the war from her grandpa gt I remember the first days of the war very well Grandfather delivered the mail to the villages and brought the news the war broke out There still was no radio back then nothing And he brought the first call up papers I also remember the first reports about the fatalities in the village Before the German occupation of the village there were explosions in the area that destroyed the houses while the farmstead itself was left without authorities Soon the occupiers arrived gt In I remember how the Germans came It was summer it was so hot and the sun was blazing There was only one street in the village So they came in threes on motorcycles with sidecars in threes with accordions They seemed exhilarated as they passed by But after some time on the same day the cars came They shouted Eggs chickens and took everything from the houses While narrating this incident Mariia closes her eyes and sighs heavily She interrupts the story almost immediately as if she is afraid that she won t have enough time to tell everything there are so many things kept in her memory so many painful dreadful memories Looting began with the occupation the German occupiers took a boar away from Mariia s family gt And then they went into my aunt s yard next door to catch chickens A dog was running on a chain so they couldn t get to the henhouse They fired a shot at the dog It is in agony blood clotting it ran to the barn into the pigsty a place where pigs are kept ed I ll never forget that The occupation of Izium began alike years later The Russian military fired artillery shells onto the city on the night of February It s absurd but the Russians have started denazifying the city centre s first streets like the one named after the hero of the USSR pilot Captain Orlov who fought over Izium In a couple of days Russian airstrikes began which demolished the city s residential quarters They ve been bombing the city They blew up the police office The medical school was on fire At night they shelled the centre the building of the Poliushko store was on fire The explosion was horrifying We spent the rest of the night in the built in closet in the hallway reads the first entry in the diary dated March nd During WWII Mariia lived in a small house with her grandmother grandfather uncles aunts and their children seven people altogether Shelling occurred all around but the village itself remained intact The family woke up at sunrise they had no clock grandmother baked bread in the oven and grandfather went to the windmill to grind flour Eighty years later in Mariia faced the war again this time also with her nearest and dearest daughters who comforted and cared for her Both during the German and the current Russian occupation Mariia was concerned with the lives of her relatives and animals For instance the woman says a grey cat came to her house last summer and settled there Shortly after the cat gave birth to kittens and the family hid those in a hencoop next to the house These days there are always a bunch of multicoloured cats curling up near the porch During the full scale invasion the number of abandoned animals on the streets of Izium increased Once I noticed a small black dog with a caramel coloured muzzle next to a bakery circling scared to approach people and even shuddering at the sound of a crunching waffle which I wanted to feed it Photo by

that s Ukrainian military Their cars make up the majority over here these days She continues her story just stopping and asking occasionally Are you interested Haven t I tired you out While discussing the modern war now Mariia mentions WWII at once as its wounds have not yet healed Among other things she talks about her father who joined the army in July Until he fought near Moscow and the family did not know whether he was alive They hadn t seen each other for two years gt All of a sudden one evening in late April right when the cherry trees started to bloom he came It turned out that he walked kilometres from his military unit in Kupiansk to our place Mariia s father suffered four serious injuries near Izium in a few months In a single day his arm was wounded an enemy fragment got him under the shoulder blade and a bullet punched out his calf Another shell splinter shattered the kneecap on the other leg causing the limb to be amputated He spent a long time in a hospital in the

destroyed by aeroplanes decades ago as well The house where Mariia lived was next to the railway and was attacked by the Germans gt We heard lots of explosions and saw many planes Once my mother and sister went to the vegetable garden and I was in the yard Special freight trains with evacuees were going to the east Military ones were heading to the west carrying tanks covered with tarpaulin One day the planes flew over and started firing machine guns The train stopped and they also kept shooting from there Standing in the yard I could even see the pilot red haired wearing glasses Where to run I got inside well I stuck my head under the floor mat where the beets were stored Then I felt my mother dragging my legs and we went to the cellar The house in Izium where Mariia lives now is already far from the railway although it stopped almost from the beginning of the war due to the occupiers bombed it The house at Chervonopraporna street west of the city ed was burning all night Every bit of it has burned down The sight is gruesome We are sitting and recollecting whose apartments were there It is very terrifying when you observe how life is being destroyed We will not live as before reads a diary entry as of March Mariia shares many other vital chapters of her life between the wartime memories Time and again the family moved homes in the post war years and she mentions her first job in a library and the early years of her granddaughter s life It s tangible how important it is for her to convey her I remember She recalls how she first came to work at school and over the years received the Excellence in Public Education award An incentive award in the USSR granted to educators in At this point her daughter brings us tea and the room becomes noticeably warmer from the heating In the winter of such a luxury as warm heating radiators was available to residents of less than half of all apartment blocks in the city People mainly warmed themselves using small heaters During the temporary occupation Russian invaders moved into houses from which the city residents have been evacuated and some have even been kicked out of their homes All that remained in the surviving houses was a pile of rubbish and boxes from the Russian Voyentorg dry rations A new wave of destruction blanketed the city when it became a human shield for the invaders Russian military hid their equipment near the houses of the Izium residents to evade attacks of the Ukrainian Defense Forces An armoured personnel carrier with soldiers stopped next to the water pump We watched them out of the window The soldiers started shooting so we even scooched down in the hallway It was the first time we ve seen them up close near the house reads a diary entry as of March There were different occupiers in Izium Mariia says While particular could even give some food others carried out raids and checked every apartment The manhunt for pro Ukrainian dangerous individuals throughout the city

cried as many tears in all the years as I have since February th I m scared I can t I realise that I m a person of an older generation but There were such looters here As early as February th ours were already plundering and breaking there were no Russians in Izium back then Of course not everyone turned out to be traitors Mariia s family and her neighbours swapped food water and fire Local rescuers brought milk and bread from nearby villages Residents who started volunteering also have been helping they brought food even if they found themselves under shelling The need to talk about war life and share the pain is what brings together and unites the locals Many of them are also shocked while recalling the neighbours with whom they lived side by side for years who then collaborated with the occupiers Already after I had a word Mariia on the way to the Izium railway station a local resident Valeriy tells about it gt Some put it in the sack snatched away entire stores and even offered it to me They said it is now possible because Russia will be here from now on But I said that Russia would never be here He is about years old and works as a taxi driver in an old car In a few months after the liberation of Izium such cars were the only means of transportation here The first marshrutkas local buses ed launched services in the last days of Perhaps it would not have been possible to completely occupy Izium if it were not for the collaborators On March the invaders occupied half of the city divided by the Siverskyi Donets River The centre was on the other bank and Kremenets hill where the Ukrainian flag was flying One of the traitors was a local MP from the Russian backed OPFL party and a communist Anatoliy Fomichevskiy He will be tried in absentia for having shown the occupiers the way to the city However many Izium residents resisted the Russians even during the temporary occupation Locals joined the territorial defence forces became partisans and

indescribably happy gt From the th to the th of September a mine fell near the house and people only discussed this And the next day it fell right in the yard The neighbour s windows were shattered

in London and if Rentokills statistics are anything to go by it s already begun over here Having personally heard of a few recent cases of Londoners getting bedbugs after staying in student accomodation AirBnB s or cheap hotels like Travelodge I thought it might be handy to do a thread on bedbug signs to look out for and how to avoid them Size Adult bedbugs are typically mm long which is about the same size as an apple seed but start off life only mm long which is the same size as their small white eggs Appearance Bedbugs change in both size shape and colour not just over the course of their lives but also depending on whether they had fed recently a while ago or a very long time ago This image https www pestworld org media bed bugs on quarter jpg https www pestworld org media bed bugs on quarter jpg shows the changes over their lives plus fed VS unfed and this image https citybugs tamu edu files bed bug feeding Whitney Cranshawb jpg https citybugs tamu edu files bed bug feeding Whitney Cranshawb jpg shows how much a bedbug can change in shape and overall appearance over the course of a single feed Signs of bedbugs Gaps Bedbugs are primarily nocturnal animals and during the day they will retreat into tiny cracks and crevices which is where they also lay their eggs in living in colonies meaning that you don t typically see them scuttling around during the day Favourite bedbug hiding spots often include seams in mattresses classic example https i pinimg com originals af a af a df d b ecaca ff jpg https i pinimg com originals af a af a df d b ecaca ff jpg in

example of what their markings look like on a mattress https www planetnatural com wp content uploads early signs of bed bugs png https www planetnatural com wp content uploads early signs of bed bugs png Smells Bedbugs and their infestations are also associated with certain smells because the animals signal to each other via pheromones which to the human nose often either smell like coriander or raspberries so much so that in olden times bedbugs used to be called the Coriander Bug When a full blown bedbug infestation is in swing you will often smell either a strange musty berry like sweet smell emanating from the room a smell of coriander or an acrid almond like smell they can also make rooms smell like old bed linen in general Skins Bedbugs repeatedly shed their old skins as they grow larger and develop into adults Finding evidence of light brown translucent skins like these https njaes rutgers edu bed bug images Shed skins big jpg https njaes rutgers edu bed bug images Shed skins big jpg is another common sign that a place has an infestation Blood Bedbugs typically only feed on people at night while they are asleep and then retreat before sunrise They go for any exposed skin they can find and if you have been so unfortunate to sleep in a bed that has bugs then you might see small specks or splotches of red or dried blood on the sheets the next day like this https

medicalnewstoday com content images articles line of bedbug bites on a woman s back jpg https cdn prod medicalnewstoday com content images articles line of bedbug bites on a woman s back jpg Other signs of infestation Fumigation chemical smells We are experiencing bedbug problems because years of laws that reduced the arsenal of highly toxic but also highly effective pesticide chemicals meant that over time bedbug treatments became less effective and as bedbugs began to survive treatments they evolved greater resistance to chemicals This also means that if a place has been recently fumigated it might not be bedbug free yet in fact sometimes places are taking up to treatments before they are completely free Although Sulfuryl Fluoride the main ingredient in fumigation chemicals is odorless Chloropicrin which smells sweet and is very acrid amp harsh to inhale is added to fumigation mixes to help warn people from entering places that have been recently fumigated If you suspect that you smell any lingering fumigation smells or see a place being fumigated it is wise to avoid the whole site as treatments are not always proving effective against bedbug infestations How bedbugs transmit Luggage Unlike headlice or bodylice bedbugs do not live on people s bodies Instead the most common way they get from one place to another is by hiding in the seams or gaps in or on people s luggage Clothing Bedbugs can also hide inbetween stacks of clothing inside people s luggage So to round up your plan of action when staying anywhere unfamiliar should be Smell Before you put your luggage down smell the room Does it smell like coriander chemicals old bed linen musty raspberries or acrid almonds If so there could be bedbugs Mattress Check the mattress by lifting up the bed sheets and checking along the seams of the mattress for signs of bedbugs and their distinctive faecal patches Bedrame Check the bedframe by looking along the joins of the bedframe behind the headboard and inside any cracks or splits in the wood for signs of bedbugs and their distinctive faecal patches Luggage Keep your luggage closed at night and ideally opt for hard cased luggage bags over soft luggage bags Clothes Keep your clothes inside of re sealable plastic bags Torch Pack a small flashlight in your luggage to make checking your room for bedbugs easier Floor Don t store your luggage on a carpeted floor instead opt to store it on a smooth flat raised surface Checks Before you leave your stay take your luggage into the bathroom where it is bright amp light shake it out in the bath or shower area and inspect things like the pockets amp straps to make sure that no critters have hitched a ride If you have access to a vacuum hoover give the luggage a quick going over before you take it with you Ineffective Over the counter insect repellant sprays and insect killer sprays like Raid are all ineffective in strength against bedbugs and so inadvisable to spray on your luggage self or clothes which will unnecessarily expose you to toxic chemicals Home Once you get home keep all your holiday clothes sealed in bags until they have all been washed amp laundered with detergents and vacuum hoover the luggage cases Scents Bedbugs are reported to not like the smells emitted by natural lavendar citris fruits cinnamon amp mint so some people believe that if you make your luggage smell of these scents then it might help to deter bedbugs from hitching a ride on it If you suspect even the slightest bit that your room might have bedbugs in it inform the manager straightaway and demand a new room a hotel has absolutely no right to force you to sleep in or pay for any rooms which have bedbugs in them The strange behaviours of Paris s bedbugs Unusual places Bedbugs always used to be associated with bedrooms and luggage but in recent years there have been increasing reports of people seeing bedbugs in places such as cinema s and on public transport like the Metro systems carriage seats https www youtube com watch v mPjbn DuWGY https www youtube com watch v mPjbn DuWGY No longer strictly nocturnal There have also been increasing reports of people witnessing bedbugs actively scuttling around during the daytime So it is advisable to not just exercise caution when staying in places like AirBnB s hotels student accomodation and hostels but also in other public places that have soft furnishings such as seats on buses trains cinema s and tube carriages Edit spelling amp x B"

morning then lays there going through her social media Eventually she gets up and takes a long ass shower dresses Which takes her forever and she usually sits wrapped in a towel on her phone then lingers over her coffee times out of she s running late for work and ends up speeding to make it on time Naturally she s gotten a number of speeding tickets I ve tried to help her eg putting her phone where she can t reach it from bed so she has to get up to snooze it but she literally just grabs it and goes back to bed You try to get her to move her ass and she just digs in her heels and takes

it she TELLS me I ll need you to cop this one and say you were driving so I don t lose my license and of course I refused telling her she needs to live with the consequences of her actions and maybe she should stop speeding and wake up earlier This argument went on for a few days until she finally conceded then proceeds to tell me well you ll have to drive me to and from work until I get my license back and I tell her I won t be doing that her work is literally in another direction than my work is from home and doing so would add another two hours of driving per day She says it shouldn t

Basic Cherry amp x B https www reddit com r TrueOffMyChest comments vwqg im just found out that my fatherm baby https www reddit com r TrueOffMyChest comments vwqg im just found out that my fatherm baby July I grew up thinking my mother had abandoned us That is what he always told me He told me my mother packed up and left us when I turned years old I grew up to resent and hate her Mainly because I saw how my father was working super long hours to make ends meet I hated how my grandma basically had to raise me When I would ask her about my mother my grandma painted a picture of a bitter spiteful hateful spoiled entitled woman I felt very justified in my anger and hate for her That s what my family told me and I had absolutely no reason to doubt them A few weeks ago I found her on social media while at my boyfriend s house And I was so fucking mad She was out there living her best life She is a cook chef in a Michelin star restaurant She travels has a huge apartment and apparently is married to a gorgeous man In a fit of rage I DM d her cruising her out for abandoning me to live her frivolous life and that karma would come to her She obviously saw it Instead of going off on me she just asked me to meet her and that she felt like I had a right to express my anger to her in person and that she owed me as much I was starstruck because my father said she never stood for the consequences of her actions Without telling anyone I agreed She invited me to this amazing restaurant She paid an Uber for me and everything It was very awkward at the beginning I kept berating her I was so angry I cried a little She just sat there and took it all in I then asked her why she abandoned me She then asked this is all paraphrased Do you really want to know the whole story It is not nice and you will not like it I am ready to be the bad guy in your head forever and keep my distance I just kept pressing her And then she told me the real story This is again paraphrased and to my best recollection She told me that my father and she met shortly before ending Uni At that time my mother had said she did not want to stay in uni town A few months after dating my father told her that his landlord was evicting him because the apartment was needed for immediate family use She offered him to stay while he found something else Moths passed and he was not doing anything Then she got a job offer in another country She told my father that he could take over her apartment or come with her They had this huge fight where my mother told him that she was not ready for the type of commitment he wanted She wanted different things in life than him and that as much as she loved him that they weren t compatible They stayed living together and then one day she found out she was pregnant She told me honestly that she was thinking of not having me She did not feel ready to be a mom at She did not feel maternal feelings She said she was already struggling with depression and late diagnosed ADHD My father convinced her to have me He said he would take me because he had a right to me That he would go after her because that baby was also his So she had me She said that the time after birth was really bad My father was dragging out the legal procedures he refused to vacate the home My mother said that while she felt love for me and that there were moments when she felt overjoyed it was overshadowed by huge waves of suicidal ideation She was scared that she was gonna hurt me She also showed me some of the court documents of that time that backed up her claims In the end she was so desperate that she agreed to stay with my father if he agreed to be the main caretaker He did but only half assed My mother then told me that it got so bad that she tried to commit suicide around my second birthday after a particularly nasty fight where my father admitted to having tampered with her birth control She showed me the papers of the involuntary hours commitment and the legal documents where she was found unfit to be a parent afterwardI felt nauseous after all that I would have not believed her hadn t she brought so much evidence with her She then asked me what I meant in my message that we were struggling I told her that we were not exactly rich and that I was struggling to come up with the money to go to University in another city She was bewildered and asked me what my father had been doing with the monthly payments she was making I told her that we don t receive that money Then she took out another stack of papers Guys she is sending child support every month It is almost k every month Edit She is court mandated to pay me k She doubled the payments out of her own will She doesn t have to pay that amount She wants to She was very concerned about this and told me she would talk to her lawyers ASAP to transfer the money to me directly In the end she apologized to me She is very sorry to have put me through this She was very sorry for not being stronger and she was very sorry for letting me grow up the way I did She was crying I was crying She then told me to take my time She would contact me again regarding the payments and that it was up to me if I wanted to see her again That she couldn t be the mother i wanted but the least she could do is help me with anything that I need I hugged her I cried She cried I boxed up my food and she got me another uber home At home my father was not there So I went straight to bed and left early the next morning and am staying with my boyfriend My whole life is a lie Just found records of domestic violence from my father f to my mother f My m life keeps crumbling https www reddit com r Advice comments vxk nu just found records of domestic violence from my July I have found out that my mother never really abandoned me because she didn t want me but because she tried to commit suicide and was deemed unfit to parent and that my father basically baby trapped my mother with me After the post yesterday I went snooping even more because I do not trust my father anymore I found records of domestic abuse perpetrated by my father toward my mother He was charged but never ended up going to jail or did a very reduced sentence This would have been when I was after my mother was committed I also found a Restraining Order filed by my mother against my father It was so much worse than what she said He did not only abuse her emotionally but also physically I am feeling so disgusted I could just scream I returned to my boyfriend again My father has been calling a lot asking why I had spent so much time away from home RN my excuse is a family emergency of my boyfriend After yesterday s I wanted to confront him but now I don t feel safe Any advice Caught my father m in a lie should I m just cut my losses and cut him off from my life https www reddit com r relationship advice comments vzs z caught my fatherm in a lie should im just cut July amp x B My life was put upside down for the past weeks Tldr is that I found out my mother did not abandon me but tried to commit and was deemed an unfit parent due to her mental issues She was giving my father k a month as child support k was court mandated k was out of her own will I also found court records of my father being charged with physically assaulting my mother on more than one occasion So after staying for a while with my boyfriend I decided to go home for a while because I wanted to get my legal documents and all of that My father came back home and we talked a bit I just asked him by the way did my mother never send you child support for me My father just scoffed theatrically and went on this rant about how courts are always accessible to the mother and how they told him he couldn t expect anything from her and so on He pulled that whole story of him begging her for money when he didn t have enough money for my school supplies and her turning him down I know this is a lie My mother kept itemized records of all her money wires to my father every month since she had a job meaning for over years she has sent my father money In the beginning she sends him then then and eventually Then he kept talking saying how hard it was That he wished he would have gone after her more But that the courts were not in his favor He told me how even now we were barely able to go paycheque to paycheque His rant was surreal After he left to go god knows where I went snooping through his room where I found a stack of cash in his sock drawer It was over k crammed into the back of his drawer Things are getting worse I feel so weird I can not describe the ick I have all my documents and wrote my mother so we could maybe meet again Should I just ghost my father Update I m just found out that my father m baby trapped my mother f with me https www reddit com r TrueOffMyChest comments w waj update im just found out that my fatherm baby July CAUTION VERY LONGWhat has happened in my other two posts I found court documents that confirmed that my mother had been physically assaulted by my father Upon further research I determined that my father spent months in jail for the assault That was when I was years old which would explain why I do not remember anything at all about that I met with him a few days ago This is when I asked again about Child support Posing the question like Hey dad did my mother never give you any child support for me He denied ever receiving Child support citing that courts will go easy on women That same day I snooped around and found a stack of cash with over k in one of his drawers I did have the data to the household account but the k monthly payment was never figured in that account Also I scouted for withdrawals for more than dollars at a time that maybe could explain the k stack which was only composed of dollar bills Nada Some background Until posting here I never realized that my relationship with my father was not normal I explain more about his behavior in the previous but as a bit of an explanation He made me his accountant from a very young age I had to keep track of expenses etc And so many times I was having panic attacks because we would not make it to the end of the month with the money on the account So many times my father would berate me if I ever asked to go out e g to the cinema because we couldn t afford it When he would allow me to go out it was always attached to an endless list of requirements that were absurd Again let s take the example of the cinema I would ask him a week prior and he d say yes but that I had to clean the house drive grandma to the doctor pick up xy Leave some dinner ready for me and many more So that if I did not complete one single detail like not bringing out the trash he would pick up a fight with me making me feel guilty and thus staying home He would constantly make me feel worthless Saying I would not survive in uni that I was not talented to do this that I was not good enough to do that He is extremely reactive one time in the car I teased him that I would be for the other football soccer team tonight and he kicked me out of the car making me walk home alone There are so many more examples I thought it was merely my fault or that other dad were also like this But suffice to say it is not normal What happened now I did in fact contact my mother after finding all this out I confronted her with the newfound information She admitted that it was quite bad and she did fear for her life My father apparently had friends in law enforcement that were following my mother and making her life impossible giving her tickets for the most inconsequential stuff pulling her over for random controls everything possible to intimidate her or to find dirt on her My father put her to the ultimatum of just singing over without a fight or he would make her any my life impossible My mother told me that he had been abusing her since I was born As early as one week postpartum So when my father uttered the ultimatum she felt hopeless and just tried to end it It did not work and after she was released my father served her and battled for full custody Because she was deemed unfit to parent it was really easy for him She told me the court actually went pretty hard on her About a year after that my mother attempted to establish visitation with me She reached out to my father who invited her over He told her that she could be in my life if she agreed to be together with him again My mother told him no and then a fight ensued That was the night he assaulted her He assaulted her so badly that she wound up in the hospital In the hospital seeing her wounds they had to report it So he was sentenced to a year but only served months At that time custody of me was with my grandmother My father resumed custody of me at the time of being release I was able to corroborate all this after reaching out to my aunt who has not spoken to our family in years My aunt Mia basically documented my mother s abuse She took pictures of her bruises and recordings of my father screaming and threatening her She told me that she testified against my father in court and that she could just back up everything my mother said because he was the same to her I insisted on seeing the pictures and recordings My aunt was resistant to this But apart of me did not want to accept that this was reality So yeah my father is a fucking monster I told my mother about everything monetarily that I had found out She said that legally there was not much we could do But she spoke with her lawyer and seeing as I am she started the motion to start transferring me my Child support money She said that for the time being she would give me k monthly while she still had to pay my dad the money As soon as the process is greenlit I am going to get it all She also agreed to pay for my Matriculation fees as well as for the deposit and first month s rent of an apartment in my uni town so that I could be as independent as possible For now I have only sent in my applications a couple of weeks ago so I should get any news on that front latest by September We decided that confronting my father was not a good idea For neither of us So we decided on telling my father that my boyfriend s parents invited me to vacation But he does not know I am gay So we plan on telling him that this is the last vacation to say goodbye to my friend I have talked to my boyfriend and his parents They did not even hesitate and immediately said yes They now know everything and support me percent So my mother and his parents are sending us for weeks to a nearby country where they have a summer house I told my father about the plans and he said that as long as his parents were paying that it was alright He did tell me that I had to help him with a million things before leaving again So I am already seeing a fight on the horizon But I have managed to get all my important documents and open a bank account thanks to my Aunt s help So on Thursday I am officially leaving for weeks and I pray things to get resolved beforehand I am taking all important stuff with me already in case things go south fast Anyways This has been an extremely difficult time And I feel overwhelmed with this all So please don t reach out probing me for an Update I will update when I feel it is right and when i feel like I can do it This has been very helpful Without you guys I would have never noticed that I had also been abused and that there is most likely more to the story Even more than what I have found out It has also proven very therapeutic to write this all down in a somewhat orderly fashion So thank you so much for all the support and advice NEW UPDATE I m just found out that my father m baby trapped my mother f with me https www reddit com r BestofRedditorUpdates comments wrvcjj new update im just found out that my fatherm August I AM NOT IN THE US Don t speculate with US laws and standards They do not apply I am the original OP I saw that u alejamix had posted a recompilation of my posts on this sub and I figured this is the best way to reach out to all of you who have written me and are curious as to what is happening This is the link to the original threat here with all the older UpdatesThings went south fast The Wednesday night the night before I left my father picked up a fight with me for not taking his car for an oil change He called me everything under the sun Saying I am selfish and a brat that he raised me better He then had my grandmother come and say how disappointed they were That I was clearly not mature enough to leave for a Holliday let alone move away for university They held me awake till am under the guise of a family meeting which was basically just a reprimanding session of all I had done wrong in my life And to be honest I was demoralized I was ugly crying and feeling awful Thankfully my boyfriend called because I had not answered several texts of his He helped me transport all my stuff while my father was sleeping And I left without telling him bye He texted me around pm and my father was acting like everything was normal So the two weeks passed very quickly I got a mail that I got into a university that has a very good program for political science So I accepted and put myself on the waiting list for University accommodation Then shit blew up My mother suddenly stopped giving my father half the money So she was only paying what she was legally obligated to pay My father was losing it He began calling screaming at me to come home at once Then calling me crying to tell me that the bitch of my mother had reappeared and was suing him and now we did not have enough money to pay for the mortgage I called my mother to ask if she was actually suing him She said no and said that she had just gone through the courts to start paying me directly instead of my father which was granted Then my grandma started texting me Saying I had to come home right away because my father had had a cardiac arrest Obviously I went back home with my boyfriend Only to find our house in literal shambles There were beer cans string liquor stuff and cigarettes everywhere Everyone that was betting that my father was using all the money on drugs and lavish stuff hey congratulations You were right Apparently when I left my father decided to have a huge party He invited all these friends that he made in fancy bars I know that because the lady that was in the hospital with my dad his GF apparently She did not know about me she kept talking about our house as his summer residence I asked her a few questions She answered She is actually pretty sweet but put off by my father now that she knows how he lied So apparently my father would take the k and spend them almost fully on appearing to be richer He had bought some clothing pieces that were high quality He would hang out in these fancy hotel sky lounges where he met his GF Then would take her and her friends out to expensive restaurants and clubs She did not fully admit it but insinuated that they did coke often during those outings Much like the party that leads my dad to OD It was not only cocaine that they did I also think an amphetamine Anyway I thanked her and told her that the money was not my father s and she had been lied to She stayed till my father came to and we could bring him home Which is when she dumped him And then I broke it to him I was leaving He lost his shit He punched me He broke my nose I was really afraid He was not even fully recovered In the hospital I told the nurse how it happened and the police got involved My mother took me in the very next day She is helping me with all the legal things regarding my father She helped me move out Helped me move cities it all happened very very fast My boyfriend has been staying over because i am very afraid My father has been blocked but I have been getting threatening emails So that is that It is good and bad EDIT TO ANSWER FAQ Why did my mother not take me in if my father was so abusive I explained it already in the last posts But Tldr she had lost her rights due to her trying to commit suicide It did not get better as my father and his friends in law enforcement and the judges in our small town are heavily biased toward against women how did you stumble upon so many documents so conveniently I didn t I very sought out those documents I reached out to Mia myself and insisted in her showing me what she had None of this was perchance I have sought out every single document They are available to the public Plus if you know what you are looking for you will find them easily by going through your parents files This was not convenient This was hard work If you are why is your mom still paying CS Here you are legally entitled to CS and governmental CS till you finish University or and till you reach your th birthday Are you gonna sue your father for back payment No That would not be of any help It would be extremely hard to prove that he blew it all In the end I was fed and clothed and I had a place to stay with heat electricity and internet and running water It would take too long and not be good for anything but revenge My mother is terrified of him and I am not keen on seeing him We are gonna pursue a restraining order and are documenting all his Mails and contact attempts Someone pointed out to keep an eye out for my father opening accounts or credits in my name We are looking into protecting ourselves in that area Get a firearmNo It is not legal nor makes any sense How come your mother had a lawyer on retainer so conveniently She didn t My first post was well over a month ago My mother reached out to a lawyer shortly after to transfer my CS from my father directly to me in a very clean cut way Since then that lawyer has recommended us to another firm that is taking my our case Everything about school and University I am not on a waiting list for what I am gonna study I am on a waiting list for the dorm Till then I am staying with my BF in a long term Airbnb in the city School starts in October not next week Again I DO NOT LIVE IN THE US amp x B Update post for you guys https www reddit com r TrueOffMyChest comments y izxm update post for you guys October The post was deleted but the publication was rescued in a

comments lbztd i am finally free my father died and i feel no June Final Update My father died in the mids of our lawsuit He had brutally attacked me because I was going to leave him and the CS checks that he had been blowing on drugs and women would stop with my departure Last year my whole world crumbeled when I found out that my mother had not left us My father had abused her and made it impossible for her to take me He has made my life absolutley misserable I have detailed this over the past few months here After I was let out of the hospital my mother and I got amazing lawyers One for the assault case and the other for the misappropriation of the money The process for the CS case was quick He had to pack back of the money given to him in the past years to me directly No further fines However the assault case spiraled It was found out that he was going to attempt to plead not guilty in the case of temporary insanity He had detailed his plan to get away with this to his gf Who is not an awful human and showed the police what she had So it went from assault to attempted murder With his gf leaving him him owing a bunch of money looking at a hefty prison sentence and no more money to bail himself out he took his life on Friday I was numb the whole week But today the realization washed over me I am finally free I don t have to look over my shoulder I don t flinch when I hear steps I don t have anxiety while checking my phone I am free I am finally free"

wx aita for not allowing my mother to bring her August I NB am not close with my mother f at all She divorced my dad when I was and almost immediately married my stepfather Mark whom despite everything I was close with They remained married until I was I was upset when she divorced him and went to live with my dad and stepmom In my adult life I ve chosen to remain close to my stepdad and even attended his wedding to his current wife who is a very nice woman My dad and my stepmom are great people Since her divorce to my stepdad my mom has been in and out of relationships each time claiming this guy is the love of her life until they do something she doesn t like and they aren t the love of her life anymore Both divorces with my dad and my stepdad were for very petty reasons dad I think because he wouldn t allow her to get a new car because the budget was tight I think the one that lasted the longest was years and I think it s the current guy she s with according to my sister After I left home she never did anything with me without her boyfriends When I was she broke up with her boyfriend and tried to cry to me about it After working with my therapist I set the boundary with my mother that if she wasn t willing to do anything with me without her boyfriend to not bother and I didn t want to talk about her love life She was very hurt and we fell out for awhile but she came back around about a year later and has respected my rule since but we only get together about or times per year I understand that my mom s relationships and love life are important to her so I respect that we don t get together often Fast forward to this year I m getting married to my partner M of a decade in October It s a small intimate backyard wedding and reception bbq We live in a rural area and our backyard wedding will have roughly people My dad stepmom stepdad and his new wife have all been invited My mom asked if she could bring her boyfriend I said no because I don t know him My mom asked if she could bring him to meet me so I could meet him before the wedding I said no and that I still had no interest in meeting her boyfriends She said she understood but she felt it was unfair that I wasn t allowing her a to my wedding when my dad and my stepdad were allowed to bring their spouses I told her that the difference was that I knew their spouses She wanted to know why I was so adamant about refusing to get to know her boyfriend I explained to her that I saw no need since she d just break up with them and move on to someone else eventually as she has always done before She started to cry and told me I was being unreasonable and treating her as if she s a wh e Both my fiance and my sister feel like I should suck it up for one day and let her bring her boyfriend so she can be comfortable there I m seriously considering it but I wanted to know if I m TA here for sticking to my boundary at my wedding and what your thoughts are UPDATE After reading everything here I ve decided to email my mother and invite him I was already leaning towards telling her that he can come when I posted I decided to set some ground rules for my mother He is there as a to my mother only I made it clear to her that he is not my family and he is not my stepfather so I will appreciate her not telling other people at the wedding he is my stepfather Mark is my stepfather and he will be there He is not to be in any family photos in fairness my stepdad Mark won t be in any family photos either only my mom dad stepmom and my siblings He is not to approach me at any point during the wedding and reception This does not change my previous boundaries I m only allowing him to come for her own comfort and to create a sense of fairness I respect the fact she is in a relationship but that her love life has nothing to do with me and I wish to keep it that way I told my mother that these are my terms for him being at my wedding and my terms are final and that I hope she can respect the fact that I m trying to be reasonable I used this opportunity to remind her the reasons I put the boundary up in the first place These reasons included forcing me to do activities with her shorter term boyfriends in the past forcing me to only discuss her love life while showing no interest in my life and putting her relationships above her own children If she responds I ll let everyone know Update My mom called me within minutes of getting the email She thanked me for allowing him to come and said they would abide by my terms She said she felt really hurt that during her actions during her mid life crisis are why I m refusing to meet her current boyfriend who she says she s been with for years and that she thought things would eventually calm down enough where I would be comfortable meeting him She said she now realizes that it will never happen I told her that I m firm on my stance I think she started to cry but she said she understood and only wants him there because being around my dad and stepdad and their new wives my dad has been married for years and my stepdad for makes her anxious and he helps keep her calm She said she respects my stance and said it s her own fault I feel this way I felt this may be the start of a guilt trip so I politely ended the call VERDICT NOT THE ASSHOLE amp nbsp Additional comments to the post from OOP gt OP gt Update I will update here since mods told me I was maxed on my post gt gt I want to thank everyone here for commenting and giving their opinions Without context I think it s a little hard to understand why I m the way I am towards my mother This past has given me a chance to reflect on my own behavior towards my mother The truth of it is I find dealing with her to be exhausting and I want to explain to everyone why gt gt My mom is a gold digger And that isn t my dad or stepdad talking shit about my mom They re classy guys and would never do that This is my own conclusion My mom said regarding both divorces I d still be married if dad or stepdad just gave me what I wanted She s also tried to start fights with my stepmom because she realizes my brother and I prefer her over our actual mom It s true I m closer with my stepmom I go to her for all the mom things because she listens and cares My stepmom doesn t make every thing about her I believe my mom suffers from main character syndrome and expects to be the center of attention at every event and if she isn t she gets drunk which leads me to my next point gt gt My mom is an alcoholic She was in a DUI years ago and crashed into another car Thank goodness no one was hurt She doesn t drive anymore lives in the city an hour away and uses public transportation But she still drinks a lot at her height she drank roughly bottles of wine per day I don t really know or care if it s more or less now One of the other boundaries I set is I won t be around her if she s been drinking because that just stresses me out more I ll be honest I m anticipating she s going to cause a drunken scene at my wedding gt gt She slept with my brother s best friend years ago when they were This was a boy who my brother had known since pre school and this ruined the friendship years on and my brother will never forgive her for it My mom thinks my brother needs to get over himself and that she did nothing wrong Technically speaking she didn t do anything illegal and everyone was a consenting adult but it still felt so wrong that she slept with someone my brother was so close with It s why I don t really want my partner around her She dates younger guys This current boyfriend is years younger than her which is a little better I don t judge her for dating younger guys that s okay It s not okay to sleep with someone you watched grow up gt gt This whole post helped me see just how exhausted I am by her I realized I don t want to deal with her BS anymore I also agree that I have maybe at times shown it by being TA and being unfair and unreasonable towards her I just don t like myself when dealing with her It puts me in a bad mood However the idea of having her more in my life makes me nauseous but I want to keep the peace with the larger family grandparents aunt uncle etc I ve decided to take a page from my youngest brother s book and keep contact to just family functions He s cordial to her at family events and keeps the peace when he s around her but he keeps his distance and won t see her outside of a family event So I m going to do the same I realized she could get sober go to therapy and change her entire life around but I m still going to see the woman who drinks all the time sleeps with my brother s friend and just treats people like garbage It s not fair to anyone not me for having dealt with her and not her if she ever did or was actively working hard to change her life I do want to make sure she s taken care of fine and healthy but I also want to not be emotionally involved anymore Figuring that out is above Reddit s paygrade amp nbsp Relevant Comments from OOP Resident Test Honestly I think you need to distinguish the hurt you felt as a kid when she broke up with your father figures from what would happen now if they broke up You are an adult not a kid Her break ups are her business and don t impact you directly Expecting someone to come to a wedding with her two exes there with their new wives is ALOT Expecting her to suck it up to put you first feels like you are trying to play out some drama and feelings you have left over from feeling hurt abandoned as a kid by her breaking up your home Divorce happens it sucks for the kids but so does an unhappy marriage Feels like time to go back to therapy gt OP In my early s she used to call me whenever she had a breakup and expected my sister and me to be emotionally supportive She wouldn t spend time with me without her bfs around She was insisting I meet some guy who typically is a lot younger than her like late s or early s which good on her but still weird for me she was dating for a few weeks They d break up after a year and she d immediately find someone new Wash Rinse Repeat This was the pattern from when I was I always had to spend time with both of them All she would talk about is her relationship She would never ask me about school my job or my relationship She s only met my partner twice There s a lot more I can add about how my mom constantly prioritized her relationships over being a parent but they aren t pertinent to this story gt gt She got with a really toxic guy when I was who stole a bunch of money from her We all warned her he was a scumbag but she didn t listen After that I told her I wanted nothing to do with her boyfriends going forward She got really mad saying I was disrespectful and that any child should want to see her mother happy But I just got tired of dealing with her relationship drama and I don t ever want to deal with it again I m sure the guy she s with

tired of it I ll be honest I ve considered many times cutting contact with her but the one thing that s preventing me from fully severing ties is her parents my grandparents I love them very much and they are still hurting from my brother choosing to sever ties with her and keeping in low contact with that side of the family My brother had valid reasons for doing this to her and he will get together with my grandparents if my mother isn t there but it s hard because they want to see him at the holidays and during special moments I m getting married in Oct and this will be the st event where my mom and brother are in the same area I ve told both of them to stay away from each other but I m anticipating there will be drama because my mom doesn t like to hear she can t do something I want to make it so we can see each other and be cordial at family events but not hang out otherwise My youngest brother does something similar I don t want to write her a letter because I fear that

scene when she gets drunk and my fiance has a brother who binge drinks and has had alcohol poisoning on more than one occasion he doesn t drink all the time but if he starts he can t stop until he either passes out or someone physically restrains him from getting more I also have an Uncle mom s brother and a stepdad who are in recovery and don t need the temptation Neither fiance and I are big drinkers so we decided to just avoid any problems and just have a dry wedding We will will have a less dry reception party honeymoon with some our friends later on All of our families have been supportive my uncle was especially grateful to us for doing this since he takes his recovery very seriously and has been years sober I sent out wedding invitations months ago and said it would be a dry wedding and asked people not to bring alcohol Now today I get this call from my mom who I also sent an invitation to months ago Mom Is it true you re not having alcohol at your wedding Me Yes

decision We want everyone to feel comfortable at our wedding Mom Clearly you don t care about my comfort What if I want to have a little drink to pass the time Me Like you did at A different Uncle s wedding where you got so drunk and made a horrible scene calling Uncle s wife a golddigger Mom It wasn t my fault They made the drinks there too strong Me Right I really wish you would address this need to have alcohol wherever you go Mom I don t NEED to have alcohol I just think your wedding will be boring without it You want to have a fun wedding don t you Me It will be a fun wedding We don t

lot emotionally What the hell is wrong with you kids You need to mind your own business If I want to drink that s my business Me Well my wedding is my business We do not want alcohol there That s

everyone for the support You have no idea how much your love and constructive comments mean to me I m glad I m not alone It s not a huge update But I guess my grandparents and uncles have had enough They ve decided to stage an intervention next weekend If she refuses to get help she will no longer be welcomed at family events and she will no longer be part of the family They told me not to worry about it My sister will go as she s the only one of her children that even has a real relationship with her but even my sister said that if she doesn t get help she will cut her off too I m hoping and praying this works but given that she spent year in rehab and the second she was off probation chose to drink again doesn t give me a lot of hope My dad told me he s hiring the local biker gang to act as security We live in a small town and the nearest big city is about an hour away so it would really expensive to have a security company come out I don t have a problem with that This is the type of gang that helps out abused kids and animals and they do a lot of good where I live The worst I ve heard about them is they doled out some rural justice to a guy that was beating up the sister of one of the members and ran him out of town When my mom got her DUI she ran into someone s house and car when she tried to back out no one was hurt thank goodness and I guess it was the house of a relation of someone in the gang so they agreed to help and my dad is paying them to be security just in case They know my family one of my dad s cousins is a member and they know my mom I think she dated a guy in the gang at one point and what to look out for It may be moot if she ends up in rehab I m not stressing about her anymore I have days until my wedding I m going to focus on the final touches and

they can hold her while it winds through the system rather than her being released after hours My grandmother s upset as she thinks all of the issues should be kept in the family and the state shouldn t step in My uncles and grandfather are on the side of having a guardianship As far as they re concerned she s not welcome in the family anymore and they won t allow her to continue to take advantage of anyone in the family anymore My sister and I say let her be a professional s problem and let them figure out what to do with her My brothers don t care and have effectively washed their hands of her years ago so their stance is whatever keeps her as far away as humanly possible We can t deal with her anymore and why should we With the guardianship petitioned I m working on washing my hands of this situation entirely I m sure I ll be interviewed about why a guardianship is necessary but other than that I don t plan to have any further contact with my mom unless she apologizes and makes amends for her behavior if that s something she s even capable of anymore I just don t see that happening and any compassion or understanding I had for her in the past is gone Whatever state her life is in she brought it on herself I just want to move on with my life without her in it and be done with her for good It doesn t look like she ll be released from the hospital any time soon so there s no risk of her attending my wedding I did talk to her boyfriend yesterday after sister and I filed our paperwork and we decided to invite him to lunch He s decided to break up with her for good and we learned just how bad things were with her He s a real nice guy who s been caught up in a bad situation and had no clue how bad she could be I feel really bad for him I did decide to invite him to my wedding as I can tell he s a lonely dude who s been to hell and back Not sure he ll show but the offer is there There was a time I d have allowed an event like this to ruin the run up to the wedding but I ve been able to separate my mom s behavior from the wedding It hasn t put a damper on it Now that my mom is squared away I can enjoy myself I just put the final touches on the catering order and am expecting the last of my supplies My aunt wants to put the final touches on my wedding attire If I haven t mentioned both fiance and I are huge steampunk fans and so we re wearing steampunk attire and encouraging everyone else to dress in steampunk not required though My wedding dress is actually more of a suit situation but it looks bad ass I don t think I ll update again as I want to put all of this behind me and I don t plan to have any contact with my mother going forward I m looking forward to a bright future with my husband My mom can stay in the past and as cold and heartless as it sounds I m glad she s not going to be my family s problem anymore amp nbsp DISCLAIMER OOP HAS UPDATED AFTER THE BoRU WAS POSTED SO PER RULES UPDATE IS INCLUDED Post wedding update https www reddit com

days later I just signed into this account again with a lot of people begging for updates I don t have a lot I guess my entire story is now in the best of Reddit Thanks I guess I never knew dealing with my alcoholic mother was worthy of a best of post I just wanted to rant and sanity check myself Only news on my mother is she s out of detox and currently in a catatonic state refusing to speak eat or drink water They may install a feeding tube if she doesn t let up I think she s trying to be dramatic and get attention so do my uncles I could be wrong but honestly I don t care anymore We re not sure she has dementia but she definitely has something going on but doing any kind of evaluation while she acts like this is difficult She also has liver disease needs dialysis and possibly even a transplant if she qualifies The doctors made it very clear if she doesn t quit drinking she will die within the next years and it may even still be too late I think I d feel more sad but I ve had to realize that I lost my mother long ago I did invite my mom s boyfriend but he chose not to come He s decided to get help for his own alcohol issues according my sister I wish him the best As for the wedding I m now happily married and on Wednesday I took a pregnancy test that came back positive We re super excited but haven t told anyone in our family yet The wedding was fantastic and the day went off without a hitch We had a blast and are heading out on our honeymoon on Wednesday to Costa Rica My brothers and stepbrothers very sweetly hazed my husband during the at home bachelor party and made it clear they re excited to have another brother My stepmom did all of the mom stuff during the wedding That was already planned before all of this No one snuck in alcohol there weren t any scenes The worst that happened was my sister crying due to all of the stress she s been under I do have some sympathy but most of it is self inflicted though because she enables But all in all it was a great day and I was surrounded by those I love most I know a lot of people asked for pics on my wedding suit I will see if there s some way I can crop identifying stuff from it and post it here once I get my wedding pictures back Otherwise I ll figure out a way to post the outfits themselves That s all I have I ll try and update after my honeymoon Now it seems like baby is coming so no promises

spoilers gt happy end lt First Post My F boyfriend M has a problem with me visiting my ex boyfriend M and won t admit it https www reddit com r beziehungen comments recf Saturday August TLDR In two weeks I m visiting my ex boyfriend who has become a close friend his family and friends for a few days My boyfriend claims he s fine with it but his behavior suggests otherwise Overall our communication is good but I m bothered by his sudden change regarding this situation My ex and I were together for four years but we amicably separated six years ago as we grew apart typical of young love Since I spent two of those four years living at his parents house I grew close to his family and friends some of whom I still stay in daily contact with including my ex mainly on Snapchat but we don t chat much it s mostly for sharing updates or keeping streaks That s why I visit the town km away every year for the annual town festival to see old faces share stories and have fun The festival lasts from Friday evening to Sunday afternoon and I often help with serving setting up and cleaning I ve been dating my current boyfriend for four months locally It s a relatively new relationship but I ve learned from past relationships the importance of open communication which has worked well for us I ve never hidden the fact that I m still friends with my ex nor that nothing has happened between us since the breakup A few days ago we discussed our weekend plans for the next few weeks and I mentioned my upcoming visit to my ex s home in two weeks He didn t take it well even though he had never had an issue with our friendship before He finds it weird and odd that I m visiting my ex while being in a new relationship and I agree with him I m aware that it s not the norm I ve never given him a reason not to trust me I ve never cheated in past relationships and having experienced being cheated on myself I know how painful it is and I d never do that He says he trusts me or rather he says he has to trust me because he has no other choice He doesn t forbid me from visiting my ex but his tone and behavior indicate that it bothers him When I asked him how he feels about it he simply said I can t change it so it doesn t matter what I think I understand that communication is a learning curve and this is his first longer term relationship so I m willing to be patient as we both navigate this However it s been five days since we first talked about it and there s no improvement in sight I ll definitely still visit my ex because my main goal is to see people I m not in touch with on social media But I don t know how long I can tolerate my boyfriend s lack of communication It s just a tiny part of our relationship Most of the time he communicates openly It s just in this case he s not and it s bothering me immensely Edit Thank you very much in advance for all the comments Unfortunately I have a very busy weekend ahead so I won t be able to respond to everyone but I will read every comment Just from quickly skimming through I ve already noticed some things that will definitely give me food for thought Edit Just a few things I ve read a few times I offered my boyfriend to come along My ex s parents took me in like their own child and I m sure they would be excited to meet my boyfriend their foundling However my boyfriend declined without giving a reason He also didn t want to meet my ex beforehand claiming it would be weird Edit My main issue is that I d like to talk about the whole situation possibly find a compromise and ease both his and my conscience However it s challenging when he doesn t want to discuss it with me That would be fine we don t have to talk about everything But he denies that there s anything to discuss yet at the same time he makes passive aggressive comments that suggest he s not okay with it Edit I wouldn t have a problem if he visited an ex I generally trust him until he gives me a reason not to But apparently that might be naive of me Edit I won t be staying in my ex s house I ll be staying with his neighbor with whom I m in daily contact Edit I can t exactly pinpoint my question for you I think I just wanted to get this off my chest sort out my thoughts A few comments gt You would do that to me exactly twice the first and the last time Unbelievable behavior gt Who does something like that I would never in my life let my girlfriend go to her ex let alone stay overnight Even maintaining contact with the parents and even worse the ex I can t comprehend I couldn t do it in my life and I think it s very rare for another guy not to care if his girlfriend talks to her ex Usually it s a big no go I don t know anyone who would be cool with it gt I can understand that you don t want to simply give up on your acquaintances friends from the past However please be aware that this is a tough pill for your boyfriend to swallow He s your ex and I assume you ll be staying there as well That would be a problem for many Your boyfriend seems to be doing his best to cope with the situation and isn t forbidding anything yet you re still dissatisfied He s showing you that it hurts him and you in my opinion are just finding faults in him communication instead of seeing what you re currently expecting demanding from him I don t want to attack you but I want to give you some food for thought your views on meetings with ex partners and perfect communication may not necessarily align with his Give him some time to process this instead of counting the days when in your opinion he s not functioning ideally Update UPDATE My F boyfriend M has a problem with me visiting my ex boyfriend M and won t admit it https www reddit com r beziehungen comments shlu Tuesday September a month later removed TLDR of first post First of all a massive thank you to everyone who commented As I mentioned I didn t have time to respond to everyone over the weekend but I read everything multiple times You tore me apart in the comments but that s exactly what I needed a wake up call I realized that I definitely mishandled the whole situation by presenting my boyfriend with a fait accompli That was pretty selfish of me probably because I haven t been in a serious relationship for six years and had gotten used to a lifestyle where I only had to consider myself for decisions But that s of course no excuse or justification for my actions so on to the actual update After the weekend I initiated another conversation with my boyfriend First and foremost I apologized and basically explained to him what I wrote above That my freedom over the past few years had apparently made me selfish and uncompromising and that I definitely need to work on myself and how I communicate things I then tried to explain to him in more detail why visiting my ex was so important to me His family took me in when my parents kicked me out back then They loved me as if I were their own child just when I needed it most Not just once did they pull me out of a depressive in one case even suicidal pit and I will be forever grateful for that I m still in regular contact with my ex s friends and meet up with someone from the group about every two months I tried to make him understand that I m not specifically going to see my ex but everyone who lives in that village The annual town festival is THE weekend of the year when everyone comes together there I told him how sorry I was but that the visit had been arranged for almost months and they were also counting on my help with the festival and I would feel guilty I had been looking forward to the festival for so long that not being able to go would break my heart a little But despite all of this none of these things were the end of the world and they could somehow be straightened out If he really wanted me to I could cancel it His reaction surprised me He communicated that thanks to the detailed explanation he now understood and was happy for me to see those people again He said that what had originally bothered him was how I had communicated it He told me to go and have fun However he couldn t come along due to other commitments The following two weeks were quite uneventful Whenever the visit was mentioned he genuinely seemed happy for me Fast forward to the Friday I was supposed to leave I came home from work at noon packed the last of my things and was ready to drive off Except I couldn t find my car keys I was sure they were on the hook that morning but they weren t there I searched the entire house Nada nothing I then messaged my boyfriend who was still at work asking if he had seen them After half an hour he replied that he didn t know but he could check his pockets to see if they were there I thanked him and waited Another half hour passed and he messaged that they were indeed in his pocket but that I didn t need to come to get them it would take minutes each way by public transport because he d be home in an hour anyway I thought alright I ll wait for that hour and then leave That way I ll see him again before I go After an hour and a half of waiting I called him He was still out with a colleague having a drink At that moment I had already given up on leaving that day without being overly tired I told him not to rush that I d wait So I laid down on the couch and watched some TV series Shortly before at night my boyfriend came home slightly tipsy and acted like everything was normal I asked him if he could give me the car key so that I could leave early in the morning After a few minutes of hesitation he said that he had left it at work Up until that point I had remained calm because mistakes can happen But then I got angry I asked if he was serious Yes he said he was sorry but there was nothing he could do now The office was closed until Monday But we could have a nice weekend at home At that moment I still didn t want to believe that he had orchestrated all of this although the thought had briefly crossed my mind I also couldn t talk about it anymore and started crying To calm myself down I decided to take my luggage and stay with a friend In response he left the room without saying a word and returned a minute later with the car key which he had suddenly found and asked me to stay until the next morning After another minutes of crying I drove to my friend s place anyway and the next morning I went to my ex boyfriend s Because I was there to help with the festival I didn t have time to think about the situation or talk to him But during the car ride home I spent a long time trying to find a logical explanation for his behavior I failed miserably It s not even his car He hardly ever drives my car and when he does he usually asks beforehand So I was pretty sure that all of this was planned When I got home he acted as if everything was okay but he still seemed passive aggressive After unpacking I confronted him during dinner about whether the whole thing was really an accident After repeatedly asking him because things seemed illogical to me e g why he should take my key to work at all he suddenly got very angry He said he never said or meant it that way Was I too stupid to understand his words Both he and I exchanged insults and shouted at each other Then a plate flew in my direction and I left and spent the rest of the day with friends I knew the relationship was over but he may not have realized it yet The next day while he was at work two friends and I packed all of his things and then we waited for him to come home He probably thought he could talk his way out of it again but I told him it was over He didn t want to accept it until he saw his packed things He became loud and aggressive again but after a ten minute tirade he finally returned my house key threw it on the ground and spat on it with the words You damn slut you ll regret this when you die alone But at least you can screw your ex without a guilty conscience That was surely your plan that s what you wanted right and then he left Since then I ve blocked him everywhere and haven t seen him and I hope it stays that way I used to think that stories like these when you read them on Reddit are often exaggerated or even made up And now something this crazy happened to me I have no idea where it came from or how deep these aggressions were lurking inside him To be honest I m still shocked by what came out of him I ve never been so afraid of another person and actually don t want to deal with the incident anymore which is why the ending is probably quite short and lacking detail compared to the rest of the story TLDR I sincerely apologized and promised to work on myself My boyfriend told me he forgave me and it was okay for me to visit my ex but on the day I was supposed to leave he hid my car keys to stop me I ended up going anyway and when I returned home he exploded because I went He threw a plate at me Now he s also my ex boyfriend but I definitely won t be visiting him A few comments gt You made the right decision to break up with him Such manipulative behavior destroys trust and you can t have a relationship with someone who plays such games I m sorry it escalated this way Aggressive behavior is also unacceptable Obviously it made him very insecure that you went to see your ex I think almost anyone would have felt strange about it I would have asked him if he wanted to come along instead of excluding him Before the relationship failed your communication failed However that does not justify his behavior under any circumstances gt The comments section is wild Many seem unable to distinguish between allowing prohibiting and you can do XY but I have the following opinion and will probably draw those consequences The end result may be the same but the former implies a power imbalance while the latter does not Allowing or prohibiting things is done with children or people over whom one thinks they have control The other option is a relationship on an equal footing where each person can decide for themselves about possible consequences So if someone wants to visit their ex you can say You are welcome to do that however I don t like it for these and those reasons and I will reconsider our relationship Then both sides know where they stand on this matter and can make a decision with appropriate consequences For some this might be a deal breaker for others not Hiding car keys manipulating and throwing dishes are absolutely unacceptable It s good that OP decided to end the relationship Reminder I am not the original poster and the posts and comments were originally in German Marked as concluded as they broke up"

since we were children since we used to spend time together due to family problems she began to have depression amp x B It wasn t like before now all she did was scream get angry or even blame me because I didn t have the same problems as her the truth is I was trying to help her but my own mental health was beginning to deteriorate so I decided little by little to move away Months passed and I had no contact with her until one day my father came to my house and called me I went out to meet him and he received me with a slap in the face it should be noted that my father had never hit me before who did that was my mother and only for specific reasons amp x B When I ask him about the reason behind the hit he slapped me again and told me to get out of the house that his brother my cousin s father had told him that my cousin said that I raped her and that s why she was so depressed apparently her dad realized that she was cutting herself and to get out of it she just blamed me for everything my cousin didn t press charges Obviously because there is no proof but still my dad told me that my uncle wanted to beat me up my dad was disappointed in me he hit me again called me an abuser insulted me and told me to get out of his house my mom was always a submissive person with him so she didn t say anything to him I simply with my lip bleeding grabbed my most valuable things

a bad time for the next few years I had a couple or two for a few years and jumping from job to job to survive When I was years old my partner at that time told me that I could work at the KFC where she worked as a delivery order receptionist The part time job paid well and with the bonuses you could even earn double or triple my salary so I worked there doing the best I could while studying a technical degree in administration amp x B Years passed and I ended up becoming a supervisor and then manager of that store thanks to my technical degree in business administration At the age of I became a partner with a former university classmate with whom I still had contact She is a lawyer and the age of we got married it was a small wedding because both she and I are modest with expenses and because I had no family to invite we currently have a one year old son whom I love with all my soul amp x B It was after this that everything went to hell today in the middle of the afternoon there was a knock at my door it was my parents it had been more than a decade since I had seen them I was frozen but not with fear but with anger my dad asked me if he could come in I told him no so we talked in a nearby park in short they told me that my cousin had committed suicide and that in her letter she confessed the whole truth that the person who actually abused her was her mother s brother and that everything was orchestrated by him to be able to cover up and other things the truth is I was very indifferent for me whoever accuses of those crimes deserves to suffer them in flesh so I didn t feel sorry for her I told them kindly and resisting my urge to yell at them to go away and never contact me again that they were dead to me amp x B When I stood up from the bench to go home my dad grabbed me by the shoulder he told me that we have to keep talking I told him no he insisted I told him no he insisted again so I turned around and instinctively gave him a hit I don t know when my dad became so weak any latino knows that country men are quite strong but one hit was enough to break his nose he stood stunned looking at me with his eyes open and his nose bleeding and my Mom was covering her mouth for some reason that I don t explain my next reaction was to throw myself at him it wasn t difficult to knock him to the ground and I continued hitting him when he started to cover his face I started hitting his head or forehead I ll not lie it felt liberating I felt like I was crying while I hit him and I continued until my right hand was hurting amp x B My mother stood still for some reason she didn t do anything she just stood there watching and crying by that time it was already night and in our area it was difficult to find people on the street even less so considering that today there is a soccer game my Mom helped my dad and took a taxi she didn t say anything to me she didn t scream she just cried and as soon as she grabbed my dad she ran away I m not lying if she had tried to intervene maybe she would have gotten the same treatment amp x B A few hours later my mother writes to me on my cell phone apparently they contacted a friend from university I still have my social networks active who told them where I lived saying that my father needs a septum reconstruction because it was perforated and dental reconstruction For having broken teeth everything was going to cost the equivalent of k USD which is a lor of money here not a fortune but it s a lot amp x B I have already been clear with her I am not going to put in a single cent for my sake she and my dad could end up just like my cousin I don t care she has been calling me asking for forgiveness for everything that she wants to come back into my life that she was afraid and that she should have protected me or at least believed me according to her my dad felt the same and according to him he deserves every hit I gave him I guess we agree on that amp x B I told my wife everything she already knew what happened in the past with my parents she just told me that she understood that according to what I told her my father died when he kicked me out of his house so who did I hit was just a stranger with his face I found her comparison funny and I agreed with her she told me that if they tried legal measures we would simply say that it was in self defense a law was recently passed in which lethal force can even be used when It s about self defense so if something happens to him we can rely on that right now I m glad I have a lawyer wife I can t help but feel more liberated after this my parents aren t poor so I know they ll get the money for the operation I hope they just aren t idiots enough to come back to my house this is my home now and if I have to beat them both to get the hell out of my life I will at the end of the day they are the ones who started all this I was just defending myself amp x B I still feel a little euphoric and happy the truth is I am a little happy that they are suffering they deserve it I am happy with my life and my family and I would protect them at any cost that includes my parents I needed to get this off my chest somehow so I m writing this to release it somehow telling it all has made me feel better amp x B"

        "cleaned_text": "Seppo Antero Boisman and Nils Wilhelm Gustafsson had both been inseparably close friends since they were years old and often spent the nights at each other s houses and both became electricians after graduating from school In May of Seppo now began dating a girl year old Anja Tuulikki M ki Around the same time Nils began dating another year old named Maila Irmeli Bj rklund Two weeks after Nils s birthday the four https imgur com jxggl L decided to go camping near Lake Bodom outside of Espoo located in Finland s Uusimaa Region Maila was excited for the upcoming holidays and her first summer without having to care for her younger brothers Although Seppo and Nils s parents saw them as reliable and trusted them Maila and Anja s parents were reluctant to let them go camping alone as they saw it was unsafe and only agreed after relentless begging The campsite was a minute drive from their home in Helsinki They arrived on June and Seppo got to work borrowing a canvas tent brought fishing gear a few knives pliers two bottles of strong liquor and a dozen light beers from home Nils bought bread sausages and snacks In the afternoon the Seppo and Nils borrowed two motorcycles which they used to drive them and Anja and Maila to the campsite The four set up on the south shore of the lake where they found a satisfactory camping spot on a small peninsula Only a few steps away from the beach Their camping spot was noted for being in a safe and private location Seppo and Nils not long after dropped off their backpacks and reboarded their motorcycles and drove back to the campsite canteen one kilometer away from their campsite They purchased a few packs of chewing gum and bottles of soda to mix with wine By the time they returned to the campsite it was already p m and thus not many people were outside anymore The last thing known about what they were doing was how they set up their single tent which could barely fit all four people leaving it quite crowded Early the next morning on June two young people were going for a stroll alongside the south shore of Lake Bodom It was nearly a m when they heard the sound of someone moving and found higher ground to try and locate the source of the sound There the two found two motorcycles leaning against a birch tree They also found a partially collapsed tent On the tent was a man lying on the tent His face could not be clearly seen and could only note that he was wearing dark trousers Later they saw another man walking away from the tent and into the woods The two again couldn t make out his face and only saw that he was wearing a light coloured shirt The man entered the woods and later disappeared The two wanted to get a closer look at the motorcycles but left so as to not disturb their fellow campers Around the same time a year old boy named Olavi Kivilahti was sitting by the rocks near the lake waiting for those he was fishing with to return While waiting he noticed a young man about years old of average height with brown hair combed back wearing a light coloured shirt and dark trousers walking out of the forest He then walked southward and disappeared from his view By a m more and more campers were waking up leading to the tent being noticed by many more A group of teenagers swimming in the lake nearby to the campsite saw the tent collapsed with a man lying on top of it They assumed there was a fight going on between campers and decided they didn t want to get involved At a m a passerby saw the same man lying on the tent and he would be the one to finally take action He ran towards a nearby construction site to use a public phone to call the police The local police accompanied by detectives arrived The man lying on top of the tent was Nils Nils had been heavily beaten as his face was swollen including his eyes swollen shut Nils also suffered several fractures to the left side of his jaw cheekbone and temple Other injuries consisted of stab wounds to his left forearm and right face and a stab wound to his cheek that completely cut through the muscle exposing his teeth The police looked inside the tent https imgur com m Ypv and found the other three campers https imgur com LYq T Seppo was lying on the edge of the tent near the entrance with his hands placed on his chest He had been struck several times on the chin and face with a blunt object with several fractures to his skull Furthermore he had been stabbed multiple times through the tent canvas with two fatal wounds to his neck and chest Anja was found curled up face down with her shirt pulled up over her head She had suffered several blunt force wounds to her head resulting in skull fractures Lastly Maila was lying near the tent of the curtain her left leg was parallel to Anja s back and her right leg was bent on Anja s head Maila s shirt was pulled up to her shoulders and her jeans pulled down toward her knees She had suffered three blunt force wounds to her head resulting in fractures to her skull and jaw causing severe brain swelling and intracranial bleeding Lastly she had suffered stab wounds to her neck and shoulders Nils was miraculously still alive and rushed to hospital The police believed that the killer first cut the drawstring and left the canvas of the tent alone so he could easily see the heads of the campers to strike with them being trapped and unable to escape under the tent and that they wouldn t be able to see their attacker The police collected all of their items from the crime scene consisting of clothes bags cigarettes cosmetics and a lyrics book belonging to Anja Police also found four knives but none of them were the murder weapons Two of their bottles of alcohol were left behind with one containing an unknown fingerprint not belonging to any of the four Several other items however were missing consisting of their wallets and ID cards a knife Seppo s leather jacket two male watches shoes and the keys to the motorcycles Over the next few days police alongside several volunteers https imgur com vD k jR and even soldiers conducted various searches of the campground The police used metal detectors and dogs as well as searching the lake https imgur com k Noo t and using divers to go to the bottom of Lake Bodom with every single item recovered from the bottom of the lake being recovered On the side of the road meters away from the crime scene the police found a pair of worn out brown leather shoes https imgur com Up fwA under a stone with several blood stains on them and another pair of shoes in the bushes across from the road The first pair of shoes belonged to Nils while the other pair were Seppo s Due to the violent nature of the crime it was made the police s main priority The police appealed to the public for information and asked them to come forward if they had any information on the killer After this appeal the police had to deal with dozens of false leads including people being reported to police for no other reason aside from being out late None of those reported to police had any evidence indicating guilt and every single suspect was released The police s investigation reached a dead end for the time being as they had no suspects While the police were chasing leads the locals had their own suspect a year old man named Karl Valdemar Gyllstr m https imgur com WTrW XB Karl owned a Truck Stop and Kiosk nearby to the canteen and campsite so many campers would often visit his establishment to purchase various items Karl was known for his violent temper which seemed to come and go Karl would hide razor blades inside the apples growing on trees near his property to stop and punish the Children picking them and was known as a heavy drinker who despised campers at the lake Karl was also known for attacking others A local resident saw Karl illegally hunting on his land and when he asked Karl to leave he raised his shotgun and shot the man While the wounds were not fatal the man had to go to the hospital to have shrapnel surgically removed Karl also held an obsession with the right of way on the road One time a truck was driving near his business which led to Karl shattering the glass and nearly causing an accident Karl defended his actions to the police by saying he was trying to scare him off for driving too fast and honking his horn too loudly Karl always kept a hunting knife and steal pipe on his person at all times and would wooden strips with nails sticking out on the roads to puncture the tires of passing cars and would trespass onto the campsite to cut and vandalize unoccupied tents On June Nils and Seppo had visited his truckstop truck stop and purchased some items before leaving Karl wasn t working at the time so they conducted their transaction with his wife After making their purchase they drove past Karl s house on their way to the campsite and Karl s wife admitted to her husband that there were four camping nearby The morning after Karl was informed of the murders by a local and he reacted to this news very nonchalantly Karl had just installed a well on his property which only made locals more suspicious suspecting that Karl disposed of their belongings and the murder weapon at the bottom of the well Their Nils and Seppo s shoes were also found on the road leading to his truck stop and home Karl and his wife were questioned by police Both Karl and his wife said they were sleeping the night of the murder with Karl staying in the living room and his wife sleeping upstairs with the couple s children His wife did admit that the door was open but she didn t hear Karl leave The police searched Karl s home but left after finding nothing of note This search left the locals very dissatisfied since they viewed it as lacklustre and were especially disappointed with how they ignored the well and didn t search it On June Nils woke up in the hospital https imgur com Cy X JK but in severe pain and didn t know where he was The police wanted to question him but Nils could barely speak often just moaning in pain and whenever he did speak he said that he didn t remember what happened The police waited again until June when he was discharged from the hospital and left through a backdoor to the police station to give a statement to the police According to Nils on June he and Seppo set up their tent at p m and hung up and spent time until p m when they finally went to sleep A few hours later Nils woke up to the sound of Seppo outside the tent looking for fishing gear Nils decided to accompany him and later wanted to go for a late swim anyway with Nils estimating that this was at a m This testimony was considered accurate as Anja had written in her Lyric book Seppo and Nils were drunk got up at two o clock in the middle of the night Seppo was fishing When the police pressed him for what happened next he said that his next memory was waking up in the hospital The police brought him back to the crime scene in hopes that it could trigger some repressed memories but Nils still couldn t tell them what happened afterwards The police now saw only one option left They went to the University of Helsinki and requested that a professor specializing in psychiatry put him under hypnosis to dredge up Nils s memories something this profession had success with with other patients From July July Nils was put under hypnosis three times with each session lasting one hour Nils finally described how he and the others were attacked by a man with a knife and blunt object assumed to be a steel pipe When asked if he could describe this man he said he could Based on his description the police ruled that the man was years old cm tall had an ordinary body type round face long blond hair combed back normal non protruding ears A high forehead high forehead with uneven horizontal wrinkles Thick lips a strong jaw slightly protruding cheekbones short neck white teeth thick and large fingers pimples on the forehead and cheeks and lastly he was wearing a thick fabric checkered dark blouse with small black buttons Based on this description a composite sketch was made and released to the media https imgur com BYnRA Police received tips based on this sketch and arrested suspects with one suspect being of particular interest On June year old German National Hans Assmann https imgur com X foYkG arrived at The Helsinki Surgical Hospital by ambulance with red stains on his hands and overalls His wife accompanied him to the hospital and said that Hans passed out after experiencing a bout of stomach pain During their routine tests a doctor poked Hans s side and in reaction he let out a little chuckle which alerted hospital staff to the fact that he was likely unconscious After he was caught in this lie Hans showed no remorse and threatened hospital staff demanding immediate treatment This prompted an intern and several other hospital workers to keep a close eye on Hans During his stay in the hospital a woman who wasn t his wife visited him at the hospital and they would whisper to each other although nobody knew what they were talking about Hans would spend hours upon hours washing his hands to try and erase the red stains on his hands When talking to hospital staff he told police he was a guard at Auschwitz but became disillusioned with Nazism after falling in love with a Jewish girl He was reassigned and ended up being captured by the Red Army in After two years in a POW camp he fully defected and joined the KGB He was discharged from the hospital after a few days but continued to return for further treatment and to make the staff more uncomfortable He once showed a surgeon an article from a German magazine about a cold case and joked that both he and the surgeon were good with a knife but that unlike the surgeon he didn t save anyone with a knife By July the hospital staff grew more and more suspicious of Hans and later suspected him of being responsible for the Lake Bodom Murders After seeing the sketch in the newspaper they only became more suspicious They called the police and even collected Hans s bloody clothing to hand off to the police Hans was however never actually arrested and his clothing wasn t tested According to police Hans had an airtight alibi but the police never released it to the public Other suspects that came to the police s attention were a man named Pauli Luoma Pauli was a bicycle thief who was seen in the area wearing a backpack that seemed similar to the one stolen from the campers and wearing what appeared to be a bloodied shirt This man was quickly identified as Pauli but he had an airtight alibi and was seen by numerous witnesses at Otaniemi during the time of the murder Another was year old Pentti Soininen Despite his young age Pentti had committed several violent crimes In at years old he was arrested and confessed to many crimes and told police that he was at Lake Bodom during the time of the murder after running away from school Since he couldn t tell the police any details that wouldn t be gleaned from reading newspapers no evidence linking him to the crime and Pentti was known for lying to try and build up a reputation the police gave little weight to his confession Pentti hanged himself at a railway station during a prisoner transport The last suspect we know the least about and the police seem to consider them POIs as opposed to real suspects Two young men were seen fishing at the lake the night of the murder and would ve witnessed the crime and possibly have valuable testimony But instead they left their fishing equipment on the rocks by the lake and left They never returned to collect their equipment were never identified and despite numerous appeals by the police they never came forward The police gradually ran out of leads and slowly and slowly updates in the investigation stopped being published in the newspapers Eventually the police ran out of leads to investigate and the case went cold In the years that followed the locals continued to suspect Karl as the main suspect Although Karl looked nothing like the sketch his behaviour was still enough as alongside his violent behaviour he sealed up that well of his only a few days after the murder In the late s his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer and when in the hospital she confessed to a friend that she believed Karl to be the murderer and gave a false alibi to the police out of fear over what Karl would do to her The police who were said to have an page case file on Karl by this point visited the hospital to question Karl s wife who retracted her statement Because she wouldn t make a statement and they had no evidence linking Karl to the murder they officially stopped all investigations of him in September of Prior to the closing of the investigation Karl was sitting and drinking with a neighbour before Karl grew suddenly angered and saddened for no discernible reason When the neighbour asked what the issue was Karl said Don t you realize it yet I am the murderer behind the Lake Bodom Massacre the neighbour said If that s true then go to the lake and drown yourself immediately Otherwise you will be locked up in a cell for the rest of your life On August the police found Karl s body floating in Lake Bodom with the cause of death ruled as likely suicide As there were no independent witnesses to this alleged confession and on account of Karl being intoxicated and mentally unwell and topped off with a lack of evidence the police did not consider this enough to close the investigation and deem Karl the killer As for Hans In he was interviewed by a reporter and when asked if he was the murderer rather than denying any involvement he said I can t disclose the details which was believed to be a confession One of the doctors who treated Hans also wrote three books about the case and how Hans was the likely killer They even tried linking Hans to other unsolved cases such as the murder of Kyllikki Saari he was in Germany at the time and even the death of a Finnish parliament and minister named Penna Tervo he died in a car accident but others think it might be foul play Hans passed away on June at a hospital in Sweeden In the police finally declassified what info they had on Hans In after the hospital called police Hans was interrogated but they quickly learnt that he had a strong alibi At the time of the murder he was staying with his mistress at their apartment in Helsinki as he was having an extramarital affair He was seen by the landlord landlady her mistress s sister and her husband It was impossible for him to leave without being noticed by anyone and he woke up and made coffee from a m the next morning Which by then would ve put him in the clear The blood on his clothing was red paint his strange behaviour was due to intoxication and the reason for his hospitalization was stomach pain as his wife had said The police had Hans s fingerprints on file and in reopened the investigation to compare them to unknown fingerprints found on soda cans at the crime scene and they weren t a match The public was still unsatisfied and continued believing that Hans was the killer based on his resemblance to the sketch Many also noticed in pictures at the memorial service taken on June that there was a man amongst the mourners https imgur com mfri HJ who looked like the man in the sketch with many believing Hans attended the funeral to relive the experience of the murder The police on the other hand stopped putting much faith in the sketch It was found that hypnosis could also induce false memories Olavi was also put under hypnosis and described a similar man but that was years after the fact when the first sketch was already known There was another reason the sketch was disregarded though and that being that Nils may have been lying In with many advancements in DNA testing and forensic technology made in the years since the case was reopened All the evidence that had blood stains on them was tested and on March the police arrested Nils Wilhelm Gustafsson who was now a year old semi retired truck driver and pensioner https imgur com alBsuP The DNA tests showed that the victim s blood was found on Nils s shoes but not his own The police believed that on the night of the murder Nils heavily intoxicated prepared a pack of condoms and attempted to have sex with Maila who rejected him leading to Nils getting angry and Seppo stepping between Nils and the two girls and was told to leave the tent Fueled by alcohol rage and adrenaline Nils waited until all three were asleep before cutting the tent ropes to trap everyone inside Nils knew where everyone was in the tent and started his attack He picked up a rock off the ground and started hitting Seppo on the head with it Seppo resisted and kept kicking eventually hitting Nils in the jaw through the tent This caused a fracture which further enraged Nils who took out his knife and began stabbing him several times through the tent fabric in the chest and neck Afterwards Anja attempted to leave the tent Nils saw this and began hitting her on the head with a rock over and over again until she stopped moving He finished the attack with Maila repeatedly hitting her head with a rock before stabbing her times After killing the three he collected all the aforementioned items and left the campsite to hide them with the man witnessed leaving the campsite being Nils himself After he was done he returned to the campsite to cut open and collapse the tent in order to make the crime scene appear more chaotic and pulled down Maila s pants to make the crime look like an attempted rape and finished by lying on top of the collapsed tent and waited for someone to discover the crime scene The next day the press got wind of the arrest and published Nils s name in the newspaper a year old woman came forward with a statement She told police that back in she was years old and camping with her friends when she saw Nils arguing with others and that this was after the murder She later saw two men who weren t police officers carrying Nils away When pressed for more details she was unable to name or describe these other men and possible accomplices Nils denied any involvement and accused this woman of lying as he had never seen her and Anja s lyric book with the entries further proved his innocence as they made no reference to an argument and there were no signs of erasing or pages being torn The police handed the case over to the prosecutor who charged Nils with three counts of murder On April The Espoo District Court felt there was enough to bring the case to trial The Trial began on August with Nils pleading not guilty and the prosecutor was Heikki Lampela who has had future legal troubles himself demanded a life sentence The prosecution repeated the same theory as the police and said that Nils only suffered a minor concussion and accused him of lying about his amnesia to avoid implicating himself For the trial the tent was restored and displayed https i imgur com XLrbJiR jpeg for the court This ended up playing a crucial role in proving Nils s innocence Nils s two attorneys Riitta Leppiniemi and Heikki Uotila began their arguments They disputed the idea that it was Nils who threw his and Seppo s shoes in the bushes as in that case he would ve walked back to the campsite all by himself either barefoot or just in socks This was an issue because both the soles of his feet and socks were clean and showed no signs of walking that long distance The prosecutor claimed that the tent was cut and stabbed through after the murders to contaminate the crime scene Thanks to the restored tent Nils s attorneys were able to poke holes in his theory Based on the blood stains on the tent all located alongside the location of the stab wounds https imgur com O wFTuw strongly indicated that the victims were stabbed through the tent The police also pointed out how the prosecutor and police in their theory of how the crime took place also included Nils stabbing them through the tent Nils had sustained many non self inflicted stab wounds which contradicted the police and prosecution s theory that all that happened was Seppo kicking his jaw through the tent Only blood stains from the four victims were found at the scene and the prosecution didn t believe others were involved in the crime The defence refuted this claim only blood samples taken from locations had been tested which meant the police and prosecutors had no way for sure to rule out the existence of a th individual The DNA by that point had also been degrading for years and even if the results were accurate if the murderer was adequately prepared and attacked from outside the tent they may not have shed a single drop of blood The defence also turned the DNA results against them and pointed out how Nils s blood was found in the location where he claimed to be sleeping They argued that if he was the killer his blood should not have been inside the tent The defence also relied on eyewitnesses who saw others walking away from the tent at the same time Nils was lying unconscious on top of it Lastly while the prosecution called upon neurological experts to testify and they stated that Nils only suffered a minor concussion the defence and their experts thought this was laughable He had been unconscious for nearly days suffered permanent brain damage and memory loss and was unable to maintain his balance for weeks after waking up and had to use a cane The prosecutor and police also never explained where his severe injuries came from As a last ditch effort a police officer guarding Nils s cell during his pre trial detention was made to testify about an alleged confession made by Nils The officer said that Nils said What does it matter What s done is done The worst case scenario is that I will be sentenced to years which they felt amounted to a confession There was no written statements or recordings of him saying this and Nils himself denied ever uttering such words The context of him making this statement was also never stated so the court had any testimony on this disregarded and that it wasn t a valid confession assuming it even happened On October the six judge panel reached their verdict Based on his blood found inside the tent the impossibility of disposing and hiding evidence with his injuries and a lack of evidence and exonerating witness testimony they found Nils not guilty with the acquittal being unanimous As the prosecutor didn t appeal the verdict within the allotted days Nils was released and given euros in compensation Due to the media reporting heavily on the case and labelling Nils as a murderer he stayed inside his house and rarely ever left to avoid anyone confronting him on the street After his acquittal he attempted to seek compensation from the media and newspapers for defamation but withdrew the lawsuit after he could find any lawyers to take the case No new suspects ever came forward his acquittal years later the case remains unsolved

the nature of predators Official subreddit https www reddit com r NatureofPredators Discord https discord gg Dqj HkRdpw Memory transcription subject Governor Tarva of the Venlil Republic Date standardized human time March The election required a colossal effort across Venlil territory to ensure that each voter s voice was heard The digitization of the election campaigns meant that votes could be cast electronically in the privacy of their homes and well in advance of the opening of physical polls Several identifiers including biomarkers were used to verify their identity early votes could be changed at any time up to the closing of the ballot collection However in the interests of not singling out anyone with connectivity problems or who couldn t access an electronic device in person voting facilities were open on the big week Many citizens preferred being part of the herd and exercising their civic rights among a crowd The results from the large percentage of online voters would be accessible almost instantly but physical votes from each city outpost or colony had to be forwarded by local governments I hadn t felt this nervous during my first election yet the uncertainty of who would emerge victorious today gnawed at me Polls were indecisive with turnout from certain demographics likely to play a major part in who was victorious A major setback was that most human citizens had been barred from participating in the election which could ve pushed me over the edge The soul of Skalga was at stake in my opinion and I wasn t sure how much of our progress Veln could reverse if he took office His isolationism would bring us further away from humanity at the worst possible time I ve done everything I can with social media outreach and campaign ads I ve visited every major city and run myself ragged going to rural villages and colonies where my popularity is subpar Any voters I could sway in Veln s strongholds would increase my chances With the polls due to close in only a few minutes I found myself watching a compilation of attack ads that Veln had spent significant money circulating on the airwaves and the internet It wasn t as if I was innocuous on this front I d gone after his meteoric rise as the nominated challenger claiming he gained the most signatures by inflating his accomplishments within a small colony s government Veln isn t ready to handle the responsibility of all Venlilkind my tagline had proclaimed I did see my opponent as clever but someone who lacked a moral backbone or a good vision for our future My rival was clever enough to claim his platform worked on any scale he d tackled so far and slammed my policies by clipping out of context quotes Tarva has proven that she cannot handle the responsibility for Venlilkind Her unilateral decisions have given you no say in your future the ad narrator declared as images of predator disease patients being led out of facilities by humans played on screen She takes her ideas straight from the new predators This was her claim about humans knowledge of predator disease A clip of me from the debate played on screen They have a better idea than we do of what s actually predator behavior Do you want a puppet leader that trusts humanity s judgment over our own Do you think predators have better ideas than us The footage showed my rival touring an exterminators guild on his colony and signing documents Veln is not a follower He s a leader who will listen to what the people want You know who to vote for I leaned away from Noah on the couch and held the remote out of his reach as he tried to cut the feed Glim seemed apathetic from his position in a reclining chair the rescue had been taken off my last campaign stops despite how useful he would be to court the exterminator vote In his current state he would ve done more harm than good to my message It would look like the Terrans were coercing him into supporting me The next ad in the compilation rolled going after me on my ties to Earth again While Tarva was running around chasing the human ambassador Veln was working for his constituents Listen to her own words about how much of her policies and recent efforts have centered around Earth a different narrator read My eyes were narrowed with indignance on screen We ve been through many stressful situations together from nearly getting shot down en route to Aafa to our efforts to stop the genocide of Earth to working hand in paw with the cattle rescues that my government and his bargained for the release of and now to our collaboration for the Summit Not only did Tarva admit to negotiating with the Arxur a true predator scourge that eats our children and ate her own she also listed all her accomplishments as things on humanity s agenda There is no difference between our planets under her leadership Behind the narrator s words images played of me running with Meier and Noah as humans stampeded and smoke rose in the background By her own admission on the debate stage your goods will cost more because of higher value added taxes to fund these adventures And for all of that the question remains what has she done for you Is your planet better now than it was six years ago The clip ended with the words Vote Veln No More Federations flashing atop a picture of my rival holding a baby Venlil I couldn t deny that he was excellent at the political game and it made me seethe Noah didn t want me to wind myself up pouncing toward me to grab my wrist He pried the remote from my grasp and switched it over to a livestream of a news channel The human winked before pointing to a clock on the mantle I flicked my ear in acknowledgment hearing activity through my campaign headquarters My diplomatic advisor Cheln peeked his head Right on time The polls have closed I prepared speeches for both outcomes ma am and sent them to your holopad Thank you Whatever happens it s been an honor working with you I acknowledged How are the exit polls looking Depends on the jurisdiction You re polling poorly in rural areas colonies or the places with the strongest exterminator guilds Dayside City is leaning toward you which is good Noah bared his teeth Think good thoughts Tarva You have a heart of gold they d be silly not to re elect you Maybe We both know the amount of change I ve brought has put me in a precarious position The polls seem to have slid toward him since the debate I thought I did well but those sound bites about humans are hurting me I m glad you ve stood up for us even when it s not easy What do you think Glim The rescue offered a blank stare I think we re going to lose Not because people all hate humans but because people hate how Tarva is way too close to you And they re right You two literally bite each other s faces Cheln pinned his ears back against his head Wait what Glim s not well You re dismissed Cheln I said hastily The diplomatic advisor couldn t depart from the room soon enough and he rejoined the larger crowd assembled around a massive screen in the lobby I would be there when the results were expected to be known but in this election it could come down to the wire Noah seemed aggravated at Glim despite the fact that the sweet human rarely showed anger toward any Venlil Even his patience had limits though he forgot about the rescue s snide remarks as his eyes darted to our television set The Terran beamed and pecked me on the cheek as the who voted early had tilted in my favor compared to Veln s However I knew better than to celebrate this early with it being this close and the rural villages being the ones that skewed toward in person ballot casting It would ve been preferable if my margin here was wider rather than depending on the last third of the votes to be favorable I cozied up to the astronaut with unspeakable weariness shooting a warning look at Glim not to mouth off again After the unfathomable stress of the past few months I wasn t sure I was ready for this claw biting long night waiting for results to come in across our space Dayside City the capital and home of the most humans on Skalga was among the first provinces to send results of the in person voters called for my re election though I wasn t sure how much I should read into that The ones who were Terran dissidents had long since moved out of the city so if anything it was discouraging that nearly a third had sided with Veln Other major cities turned out even less promising results with me narrowly holding the physical votes in almost all except for Tonalu City skewing toward my opponent That still padded my lead and Noah seemed ready to take a victory lap I respected his optimism I don t know why but I ve had a bad feeling about this election since the day began Maybe it s just my nerves internally I m not confident I have the support of my people Even if I do win it s clear from these margins that the planet is divided That was the last good news we d had in the evening Rural villages like Celgel Falls home to Glim s aunt poured in their tepid amounts of votes but several skewed around the mark in Veln s favor While one small settlement wouldn t have been enough to make a dent in my lead of millions together they were eating into the metropolitan vote These people had always been traditionalists and were known to be less than cordial with human refugees lack of interaction with Terrans meant they never had the opportunity to change their minds You can t win them all Noah had said trying to massage the tension from my shoulders The issue was that I wasn t winning any and that my campaign efforts in those areas didn t seem to have stopped the bleeding It was a blowout in every single village which I could imagine Veln feeling the swing of momentum The colonies only lowered the gap further and the numbers made my heart plummet My opponent had been actively ferrying voters on his home colony Milna to the polls and even been on one of those transports himself to plead his case in his already strongest territory I thought it had been a foolish play since he already had their votes as a popular governor but rehashing his beloved tenure paid dividends Milna was one of the last colonies to report their totals because they nearly doubled a record in person turnout Veln was seen as their candidate Veln is a hometown hero who hasn t forgotten his roots if you ask voters on Milna Jonek had announced on the election coverage broadcast Off of Venlil Prime s soil she s seen as the Governor of humans Perhaps it would ve been wise to distance herself more from the UN Not good Colonies never feel attached to affairs of the homeworld but even ones without Veln the visitor are bringing turnout They have a stake in the humans arrival and the ones who don t are no more inclined to vote than past elections My numerical advantage had been millions away from my opponent and seemed insurmountable to Noah had shrunk to a sliver as the night progressed The rural villages whittled down my advantage to half of its original count the unexpected turnout at Milna was the start of a continuing skid By the time all colonies had reported my lead was at a mere votes I fielded calls from the UN Secretary General wishing me luck and thanking me for everything I d done for humanity which I think was Zhao s way of saying they thought there was a good chance I might lose The Earthlings must be scrambling to figure out how to deal with a possible Governor Veln and they didn t want to spring goodbyes on me if I was unseated Jonek perked his ears as the camera as the news broadcast returned from a break Hello If you re tuning in expecting us to hear who the new Governor of Skalga is we have one province outstanding the science settlement of Eliga which has been under sandstorm conditions and is just making contact now I m told we can expect results from them in a few minutes What an election it s been Polling in Eliga has been a tossup and it wasn t visited by Tarva or Veln this could go either way We should go outside with the others Noah whispered Governor or not I ll always love you I wrapped my prosthetic tail around his wrist I love you too If I had to do everything all over again the only thing I d change is sending that distress signal in the first place We ll get through this Of course we will Worst that happens is you retire from public service and we get to run off together like I ve imagined for months That s not so terrible right It is what I want but humanity needs me in charge of Skalga to preserve our close alliance The Venlil can t go back completely love You gave us a chance you made sure millions of people who never would ve thought about dealing with predators did the same and you saved our species to boot You ve done so much we couldn t ask any more Don t worry about humans because you ve done more than your part on our behalf Emotion swelled in my throat as I marched toward the doorway to enter the lobby with the rest of the staff These could be my last moments as the leader of Skalga regardless of what Noah said I felt responsible for the efficacy of my campaign strategies How could I justify keeping our relationship quiet to maintain my office if I lost my position to a populist charmer like Veln How could I have any say in decisions affecting millions of Terran refugees on this planet I cared about what happened to the Earthlings that was the sole reason I sought re election at all for their sake Noah glanced over his shoulder toward Glim Do you want to come with us and watch the results with the group We d love for you to join us No the rescue mumbled Why not You were a part of this team as much as anyone else I helped Tarva because I owed her my life not b because I think she s a fitting Governor A real Venlil wouldn t have argued for f for an Arxur to speak at the Summit I hope Veln wins I flinched at that sudden admission from the cattle rescue How could he oppose my candidacy after my policies freed millions like him from abhorrent conditions I had volunteered to help with the reintroduction program because I cared about these mistreated Venlil A scowl took over my astronaut s features and his fist clenched beneath my coiled tail Noah didn t speak another word to Glim instead hurrying out with me to the lobby I tried to clear that exchange from my mind but the sinking feeling that plagued me all day had reached its crescendo I didn t have a good feeling about how the votes from Eliga would shake out in my gut Ma am Kam flicked his ears in acknowledgement as we fell in beside him and Cheln The moment of truth I ve argued on behalf of your policies even when I didn t agree with them You couldn t have been more right about humans I m proud to have served your administration Thank you General I whispered Thank you for your service to our planet Let s save the goodbyes or congratulations for after we hear the results though Copy that An eerie silence overtook the lobby area as dozens of staffers saw Jonek scan some new information off screen The Venlil journalist took a moment to prepare himself savoring the suspense of the ultimate verdict The knowing glint in his eyes confirmed that the results of the election were known before he ever said a word Eliga flashed orange to signify that it had been tallied on the visual aid map all we needed was to hear the counts that would usher me into a second term or elect a new Governor in my stead It was all I could do not to bury my eyes in Noah s chest and press my paws over my ears to avoid hearing The impending news was almost too much to bear Jonek cleared his throat Eliga has submitted its votes and with the last outstanding province in Dayside News Feed can now declare the new Governor elect After winning the city s vote by a percentage of the rd Governor of the Venlil homeworld will be The journalist paused for dramatic effect and my breath hitched in my throat The election would be delivered with his next words signaling what the voters had chosen for the future of Skalga I hoped that whatever decision they had reached it would turn out well for both the Venlil people and our sincerest allies First https www reddit com r HFY comments u xpa the nature of predators Prev https www reddit com r HFY comments w un

        "cleaned_text": "When the Human Ambassador to the Galactic Concordance was called forth many knew as to the reason When it was explained as to why the Ambassador was called before the full GC Council all the Human Ambassador displayed was confusion Wait you re telling me that Humanity is on trial for war crimes and for violating the Geneva Conventions due to the manner in which we defeated the Kilgram Swarm asked Ambassador Lucielle Vargas dumbfounded at the audacity of the Galactic Concordance Yes You Humans have violated your own Geneva Conventions and therefore must be punished cried out the Suluthi Ambassador a generally amorphous species that could take whatever shape they chose depending on their mood Currently the Suluthi was a roiling mass of gelatinous goo indicating their anger Blatant bombing of civilian targets the execution of surrendering troops inhospitable living conditions in prisoner camps humiliating and public executions of captured troops and hostages the nuking of garden worlds the detonation of multiple antimatter bombs on several nursery worlds the deployment of horrendous chemical and biological weapons need I say more sneered the Elrishi Ambassador as he tossed his datapad down in disgust pointed ears twitching in disgust As the gallery yelled and jeered at Ambassador Lucielle all the Ambassador did was stand there with a bored expression Eventually they calmed down allowing Ambassador Lucielle to speak in the defense of herself and her people None of you signed it A puzzled silence filled the room None of you ratified it A few members in the gallery shifted nervously their species more refined senses alerting them to the mounting anger from the Human No other species in the Concordance accepted and applied the provisions of the Conventions when it was given to you Ambassador Lucielle was now gripping her clenched fists so tightly she was beginning to pierce the palms of her hands with her fingernails the coppery tang of her blood becoming apparent to those with keen noses SO WHY DO YOU ASSUME THAT THE RULES APPLY TO YOU yelled Ambassador Lucielle her raged directed at everyone but everyone knew she specifically meant the Kilgram What do you mean The Republic of Humanity is a member of the Concordance so every legally binding agreement is valid The Geneva Conventions are no exception answered the Elrishi in the prim and proper voice that his species was known for I also distinctly remember when they were brought up that many in this Council simply scoffed at the idea of such rules being drafted up hundreds of years ago and believed them to be so antiquated that they were to be considered invalid and obsolete How convenient that you believe it applies to everyone here now of all times especially after our recent defeat of the former premier military force in the galaxy sneered back Ambassador Lucielle So you believe that your own laws do not apply to you in this instance That you are free to commit such atrocities Free to commit them Oh no we ll pay for this in one way or another later But if any of you had read the documentation like you were supposed to before carelessly tossing them aside you would have known that there was an out for any signatory of the Conventions And what would that be That if the opposing race is not human Humanity is given free reign to slaughter them To commit such atrocities that their population may never recover snarled the Kilgram Ambassador Oh no nothing like that There is just a VERY clear warning in them The Conventions apply to a signatory nation even if the opposing nation is not a signatory but only if the opposing nation accepts and applies the provisions of the Conventions You Ambassador Klickgra and your entire species laughed at the idea of the Conventions believing that such things are common sense and that common sense would be all that is needed to keep people in line growled as her hands gripped the table before her hard noticeable cracks appearing in the normally durable table You fil started the Kilgram Ambassador began before being cut off by Ambassador Lucielle BUT YOU ARE NO BETTER THAN US Shocked silence filled the chamber as the Human Ambassador yelled so suddenly and so loudly that the sensitive auditory systems of some ambassadors were blown out before protective systems could be activated What do you mean by that young sapling whispered Ambassador Nilano the representative of the oldest still living species left in the galaxy the tree like Willowans They were affectionally called Ents by many Humans a nickname they smiled at with fondness Sirius III Rylon VIII Canus IV Alpha Centauri Prime Eta Bo tis IX Pluto Epsilon Indi V Edenia Wolf Arcturus Station Procyon Prime And what are those exactly asked Ambassador Klickgra nonchalantly though some noticed his mandibles were twitching in his species sign of nervousness Garden and nursey worlds that your species pillaged and burned Stations that were simply massive trading outposts Targets that this Council claims to be off limits based on common sense yet the Kilgram blatantly attacked those worlds Every planet has either been scorched clean or turned into prison planets where prisoners of war and hostages are routinely tortured beaten violated nd sometimes even eaten by the more ravenous guards And what proof do you have of this There is none because it has no yelled Ambassador Klickgra before he was once against cutoff this time by a ping as every Ambassador present was sent a file that contained detailed interrogations of captured Kilgrami soldiers and guards as well as video files from the security systems the Kilgram used After recessing for an hour to review the evidence submitted by the RoH every member of the Council reconvened back into the Council Chambers the Ambassador Klickgra being dragged to his seat by security of which stood next to and behind him to ensure he did not run away as he had attempted to do during the recess As the Council has seen the Kilgram Swarm violated your common sense rules first Human worlds have been stolen burned or irradiated to the point of uninhabitability Republic citizens have been stolen from their families We have found some but most we cannot find evidence of their Of those we found alive many were sexually violated without a care for age had missing limbs due to either amputations or being bitten off by their captors or they were found slaving away in mines with little to no protective gear Casting her gaze around the room her glare settled on Ambassador Klickgra I could have sworn that slavery of any kind as well as the eating of sapient beings was outlawed if not officially then through COMMON SENSE growled Ambassador Lucielle shouting the two words so loudly that the Kilgram Ambassador flinched back Returning her gaze to sweeping the room seeing that many in the room were apologetic and in sub servient positions she continued We gave them every chance to prove use wrong That they were the better people they said they were We submitted reports on all that we had discovered as per protocol yet nothing was done Every report every complaint was swept under the rug From your reactions most of you never saw these reports which only tells me that the Galactic Concordance Security Council is to blame for keeping this from you If you had been informed as per protocol the war would have been put on hold until we were proven right the war ended and reparations would have been made Taking a deep breath along with a sip of her water she continued Instead instead the FACTS were kept from the rest of the Galactic Concordance Council Meaning that escalation was the next logical step We gave them one final warning One final chance to make things right before we pole vaulted over the line Their systems and the Council s systems can prove that After they laughed at the warning they pressed on sealing their fate Sitting back Ambassador Lucielle sighed before continuing So yes We DID raze and irreparably irradiate countless garden and nursery worlds We DID detonate antimatter bombs on garden and nursery worlds We did gas whole planets with toxins and diseases so vile Nurgle himself would be proud of us Yes we cut down fleeing amp surrendering soldiers Yes we reduced whole cities to rubble and ash without regard for civilian life Yes we kept what few prisoners we had in horrendous conditions and executed many of them for the slightest offense As she finished this part of her speech Ambassador Lucielle stood up and began clearing her table As she did so she continued to speak We believed that even though the member species of the Concordance had not signed them that they would still see sense to accept and apply them to any potential conflict we would be involved in Instead our hands were tied We could either bow down to a galactic power that was dead set in enslaving us for food pleasure and manual labor or we could fight back They wanted to wipe us out and what they didn t wipe out they d enslave The Republic outlawed slavery centuries ago and a peaceful end to the war was no longer possible so extermination was the only choice left If we were faced with the same situation again we would gladly do it again if it meant our survival She then reached up ripped the Ambassador Pin from her lapel and cast it on the floor of the Council Chambers Everyone stared at either her or the pin in shock She soon confirmed their suspicions Since it appears that the Galactic Concordance cannot create or enforce any laws that benefit everyone while being so incredibly corrupt that the Security Council would keep vital information away from the rest of the Council information that would have led to this farce of a trial ending before it even began I see no reason for the Republic of Humanity to continue being a part of it You may contact us through diplomatic channels but we refuse to be a part of this Concordance any longer As she walked towards the door the entire chamber erupted in a panic as every Ambassador began receiving panicked calls from their respective government and military officials getting reports that RoH businesses were suddenly uprooting embassies were rapidly closing down RoH citizens living within the territories of various Concordance members suddenly uprooting as well their dwellings being sold for dirt cheap as billions of humans were suddenly leaving Concordance space Military officials were in a panic as hundreds if not thousands of starships of various classes began leaving various ports stations and formations only saying that their government had recalled them when an answer was demanded of them Tens of millions of ground troops were also doing the same dropships and assault ships landing near or at every installation with RoH citizens and troops As the Galactic Concordance Council developed into a panic as they attempted damage control with reports already coming in of potential economic downturns former Ambassador Lucielle smiled ever so slightly as she stepped out of Council Chamber doors her bodyguards forming up around her as they rushed towards the nearest RoH transport her office having already been picked clean by Republic Intelligence Agents Dipping her head down former Ambassador Lucielle whispered into a hidden mic on her lapel Operation Downfall is a go I repeat Operation Downfall is a go Almost immediately did she receive a response Copy that Agent Francesca Return to base when able Ad Victorium Copy command Ad Victorium whispered Lucielle As she strode towards the awaiting shuttle no longer was she Ambassador Lucielle of the Republic of Humanity former or otherwise In

        "cleaned_text": "I am an American who moved to the UK specifically Scotland last year and I have noticed a lot of differences between the two places in terms of consumption Of course this is a generalization and this is my experience but I think in general the UK has made it a lot easier to be low consumption compared to the US In the US I would have to make a conscious decision to choose the low consumption option here it is more of the default and that has made a huge difference for me to be able to live more consciously and be more anticonsumption Transportation This is a big one In the US I had a car and basically needed that car to get anywhere outside of the city center In the UK I have no car and it hasn t really been an issue You can use public transport and trains to get to many places even tiny places that I was shocked had public transport I know the UK has issues and a long history with its train system but to me as an American it seems great and I am very happy with it Here it seems like having no car is the default and you only get a car if you need it whereas in the states having a car is the default and only those in specific cities can be car free Delivery Online shopping I think this goes along with the no car needed but I have basically completely stopped online shopping and having delivery There are many shops and restaurants within walking distance of my flat so I don t feel inclined to order anything since it s easier and quicker to buy it myself Whereas in the States it was a hassle to get to the shops and battle traffic so I would often order items and food for delivery and end up paying the huge markup Food waste Now I shop for only days at a time vs a whole week of shopping back in the States Because I was shopping for a week plans would change or produce would go bad etc and I would end up throwing away a lot of food that I didn t use Here since I am only shopping for a day or two at a time the food doesn t have a chance to go bad and I am always able to use it This goes along with having shops close to my flat so I can stop by on my way It s not a huge hassle or chore like it was in the States where I had to plan an entire week of meals make a list and then deal with the crowded grocery store so I don t mind shopping more frequently now since its easier Heating Electricity My flat here is much smaller and it isn t an open concept like many homes in the US I have separate rooms with doors between them and so I don t have to use as much heating as when I was in the states and you had to heat the entire house I ll only have the heat on in the room I m in and then close the door and it will be toasty in no time Also it seems more common here to have your heating lower in general and just wear more sweaters and have hot water bottles for your bed etc Appliances here are much smaller and so use less electricity my oven fridge freezer are all small compared to the US But this isnt a problem since it s more common to only grocery shop for a few days at a time Also I do not have a dryer here and so I hang my clothes This took a little getting used to but honestly I think it s for the best because I don t use the electricity and my clothes will probably last longer Reusing Not throwing things away I feel like in general there is more of a culture here of buying nicer items but using them for a long time and maintaining them Charity shops are common here and it s very common to use them whereas I feel like in the States I didn t know many people who went to Goodwill unless they needed to Since I ve been here I have mended a pair of jeans resoled a pair of boots and re waterproofed a jacket which are all things I had never done before in the States It would be much more common to simply throw the item away and buy a new one in the States whereas here there are plenty of cobblers and alteration shops and people would think it was very wasteful to buy a new one instead of fixing the old one Overall I am really happy with my move living here has made me much more conscious of my consumption and made me live a lower consumption life I can t imagine going back to how I was before Let me know what you think or if you ve had a similar experience"

        "cleaned_text": "Some background We moved from Budapest a big city with million people but me and my wife grew up in a town similar in size to Bend We have never been anywhere else in the US except the Redmond and SF airports I moved with my wife and kids and years olds Been working for a US company remotely from Europe and they offered me an opportunity for a visa First everyone is so kind and helpful I had to go through a lot of bureaucracy it was especially hard until we received our social security numbers but no matter the case everyone was very helpful and understanding It is a bit strange for us that we receive comments and or compliments from complete strangers in the streets or when hiking but it is very sweet Bend I love the scale and beauty of this town I like walking biking around with my kids going to parks and playgrounds We go for hikes in the weekend we have two child carriers we just hiked Tumalo mountain we left behind our hiking gear in Hungary and have not bought boots yet so my wife had a garbage bag between two socks under her running shoes and I just accepted that my shoes are going to soak on the top in the snow The kids loved the snow and we loved the view so it was worth it Our favorite places in town so far are Alpenglow Park Farewell Park Harmon Park and basically all he riverbanks Kids Preschool We found a preschool for our year old and although he does not speak any English yet he really loves it The mentality effort and attention they exhibit at the pre school really amazes us especially compared to what we experienced in Hungary where they did not take the kids outside if it was raining because it is too much work to dress every kid My wife was a little worried about our kids fitting in the new environment and now she couldn t be more happy about it My daughter is really jealous that her brother can go to pre school and she cant yet My son loves all the big cars around town especially the trucks there are virtually zero trucks in Hungary he was a bit disappointed when we bought a plug in hybrid instead of a truck When I told him that there are real monster trucks in the US he did not believe me he thinks those are just toys so I am planning to look up some opportunities where he can see a real one We were a bit surprised when at our first pediatrician visit they recommended vaccine shots on top of the shots they already received back in Hungary so far the kids were not happy about it either but they got some stickers and some pretty band aids which helped Transportation We were a bit afraid of this part as we knew the US was very car dependent In Budapest we mostly relied on public transportation and bikes We bought a plug in hybrid which my wife uses for the daily trip to the preschool We use this car for our weekend trips and this is the only time it runs on gas instead of battery We bought the car months ago and have not pumped gas in it yet for miles I bought a bike for from Facebook Marketplace and I ve been commuting with it daily for work from Old Farm District to Boyd Acres I ve been very surprised that all the roads have bike lanes and the smaller roads that don t have any have virtually zero traffic I feel much safer with a bike here compared to Budapest where it feels they are out to kill you with their cars This leads to my confusion that why are so few people commuting with bikes I am biking from the Southern to the Northern ends of Bend and it is just a minute miles bikeride around a beautiful town But I think in total I saw people on bikes between am in the last months People in Budapest would kill for such a bike friendly environment It is really surprising that I don t see much kids biking to and from school and instead get dropped off and picked up by their parents We also bought a kid trailer for our bikes so we can bike to the nearby parks instead of using a car I was really happy about being able to bike so this way we are not linked together in our commute as a family or we can spare the costs of buying and paying for a second car Also traffic in Bend is much more peaceful in Bend compared to Budapest My wife hated driving in Budapest but now she says she can feel that other people are paying attention and very few are tailgating her Shopping In Budapest you have a grocery shop every m sorry about feet so we were used to just grab stuff we needed when we were moving around and not do big weekly shopping so getting used to one grocery shopping week took some time for us It is strange that all the stores are on the same few spots around town and you kinda have to go with a car I was thinking I would do shopping with the Bike kid trailer but I am not sure if it is safe to leave the trailer outside without locking it I am a bit paranoid in Budapest they steal even the locked things Food I know I should mention this but we are mostly cooking at home and have not tried many places We loved Jacksons Corner The Victorian Caf Dandy s Drive in Rockin Dave s Cafe Des Chutes So all in all we love Bend and the people here so far Hope we will be able to give back to the community sometime in the future Sorry for my bad English my son already speaks a few English words without the ugly Hungarian accent that me and my wife have Here is a picture of me in my soaked shoes preparing some snacks for my kids at the top of Tumalo Mountain this weekend https preview redd it nappef f mub jpg width amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s bd a f e ab f dad ab a e dba"

detail amp x B After the huge positive reception and even questionable media coverage of my last post about rather unknown details I found in the leaks I kept digging Here s another list about stuff I found most of it is very easy to miss when watching the leaks I know there s already a page document about the leak But I m having fun scraping details together in my own way to compile a list to share with you in a short and readable way sometimes with my own thoughts attached to it That means there s more to read this time And as always add one grain of salt to your salt sprinkler Here goes nothing amp x B The file size of the dev build was possibly around GB big My very personal guess is we can expect just under GB as the final file size because dev builds often only have specific features active which are currently needed amp x B There are safes One is in the back of an office I assume those can most likely be picked and or opened in other ways Fits perfectly into the new stealth system amp x B Underwater weapon aiming is coming So is directional swimming you can swim backwards or to the side while aiming amp x B Vehicles lean and move similar to GTA when braking turning or speeding up Vehicle physics feel like a mix between GTA and GTA amp x B Walking around with an openly carried gun could be enough to already alert people amp x B Public transport has those Rate your ride QR codes Given how advanced the player cellphones seem to be we could be able to scan those If that s also true it hints towards a very expanded ingame internet amp x B The Vice City Metro seems to have three lines spanning over stations Even different kind of train cars depending on the line Light Blue stands for Vice City Metro M unreadable It seems to cover the Vice City central area Dark Blue stands for VCIA Vice City International unreadable airport It seems to cover one half of the city maybe even leaves the city to some extent There s also a yellow line It goes the opposite way from the dark blue line probably covering the other half of the city There may also be a gray line which is a regional international train amp x B Obviously all Rockstar studios are working together on this project Found animation work from Rockstar North Toronto Dundee and India amp x B Credit Cards called Shark seem to be a thing Fleeca is also back plus at least two more which I can t see well enough to name them amp x B It s pretty clear what Jasons special ability will be Marking things of importance during a robbery I saw jewelry a safe and a security camera being marked amp x B You can buy gum from gumball machines amp x B Found a mention of the USA and Canada on a sign and heard the Eiffel Tower being mentioned in a radio Surprisingly many real world names Nothing new in the GTA universe however amp x B Wi Fi hotspots If it s not decoration only I can imagine there being such a system in the game Fits well into the expanded cell phone internet thing amp x B If you commit a robbery cops won t show up immediately It takes time for them to be dispatched If this counts for all kind of crimes and not only robberies the Wi Fi cellphone signal thing could mean rural crimes are less likely to be reported Similar to the witness system in RDR Robberies and heists will now feel much more like actual robberies because of this You can communicate with the cops or do cop related actions as soon as they arrive amp x B Excavators can possibly be driven amp x B Shooting someone in the head could sometimes still make them move around in a gruesome and way too realistic way before they bleed out amp x B Not only hotels but also inns could be a place to stay at amp x B Found an US Canada and Mexico flag next to each other They are next to the Vice City Neighborhood Enhance unreadable Community Center amp x B I seriously think the map will be bigger than we think Here are the reasons Mexico and Canada can be found being mentioned or displayed multiple times Many hints towards a big water part of the map Other people found out that the map isn t very big by itself according to the W E coordinates found in the leaks That means there s a high possibility for more to see in the northern southern parts or even beyond the coast The whole projects codename is Americas amp x B Finland doesn t exist amp x B Flashbangs flashlights amp x B Lions or Tigers exist Probably only caged amp x B One event is called Police Siren Abuse Leaves much room for speculation amp x B Saw someone talking some good news about a person and another person giving a positive response about it More conversations between NPCs And another Person How s it going Person Going badly Person negative response Person response closer negative Person conversation line Means that bigger groups of NPC people may form and talk to each other in a way which makes sense amp x B Lucia will duck around lower than Jason if I interpreted correctly what I just saw Maybe a little far fetched amp x B The Vice City Mambas will be a sports team amp x B Cars will behave differently on tarmac dirt deep dirt gravel deep gravel and grass Those are the only confirmed ones there s surely more amp x B A spear gun will most likely be usable While regular weapons aren t that effective underwater a spear gun is Another hint towards more underwater content amp x B GPS tracker jammers will be a thing which are carriable via inventory amp x B Same thing with an immobilizer bypass An immobilizer is an electronic security device fitted to a motor vehicle that prevents the engine from being started unless the correct key is present and it prevents the car from being hot wired It probably won t be that easy anymore to steal a parked sports car amp x B More things we can carry An auto dialer a cut off tool binoculars fire extinguishers pool cues amp x B Beef jerkys in your pants amp x B Golf balls golf irons golf wedges gold putters golf drivers I guess golf is back amp x B When the player sat onto a bike a text popped up saying Discovered Sanches livery Means we ll probably be able to discover vehicles in some way amp x B Assuming vanilla unicorn is back as a strip club brand I found a second unreadable one and a third brand name called Horny s More strip clubs it seems EDIT False alarm Horny s is a burger place amp x B The player has his own inventory but there s also a shared inventory between characters If Lucia is your partner you can put a weapon and a few snacks into that inventory to make them usable for her as an example I assume that s how it works amp x B In one clip the map only shows up after the player gets into a car Maybe we won t have a permanent mini map amp x B There will be Serializable World Events Means some world events could have different stages to them Those could function like the blue man icons on the minimap from GTA or Strangers and Freaks from GTA Only that they are world events Possibly without a map icon amp x B Car parts will be part of a world event and you will be able to pick them up individually amp x B Horses exist and they are rideable if they don t cut them out again like they did in GTA but I highly doubt it amp x B Conclusion A lot of interesting stuff I think it s clear that this game will have a much bigger focus on stealing and minor crimes than any other GTA game before And I m excited for that Also much more stuff you can pick up individually GTA was already a step back compared to GTA regarding that GTA will blow everything out of the water amp x B Another post incoming when it s ready Note to self Read R s patents next time More interesting stuff to be found there"

goldmine of mana too People don t seem as inclined to wait for official ODA approval for it unlike most of the other new things I make I can see Berdol in the large group that s already making their

the group I actually manage to pull a good surprise with some of the arcane hands but once they realize there s magical manual mischief in their midst they rally quickly and keep the miners from anything worse than a good scare amp nbsp They all gather outside the entrance and separate into half a dozen groups Berdol speaks up to get everyone s attention amp nbsp Alright everyone should be familiar with the plan so do your best to stick to it We don t have much information about the layout inside so make sure to keep track of where you are Teemo has said there are supposed to be a lot of traps as well as being the domain of the wyrms He wouldn t pull something deliberately deadly but he ll still keep what you ve gathered if you re beaten so don t lower your guard amp nbsp He pauses and smirks at the miners And the miners will probably not pay very much for missing out on all the ore in there As long as you all keep a good map the Dungeoneers will pay for info so keep that in mind too We ll split up once we can and hopefully by the end of the day we ll all have enough coin to buy something made from the special metals here Any last minute questions amp nbsp Nobody seems to have any and everyone seems eager to get started including Berdol Then let s go amp nbsp With a cheer everyone forms into a single large group again but now that I ve seen them split I can see everyone is sticking close to their specific party even while in the larger formation The smaller groups quickly start splintering at each intersection and soon they re all happily exploring the labyrinth Most of the groups are taking it slow going at a walking pace and keeping their eyes peeled One group is being pushed by their miners to hurry three dwarves practically slavering at the idea of the ores hidden in the maze Their protectors are a trio consisting of a bearkin with a large club a changeling that looks like a fire mage and a goblin with a lot of crystals While I d guess the bearkin is a berserker I don t know what the goblin is amp nbsp The typical party makeup would suggest either a ranged attacker or some kind of support but I honestly have no idea what the little guy actually does I decide to watch them as they delve curious about how they fight and if they ll stumble into a trap in their haste amp nbsp The bearkin and changeling lead the way with the miners in the middle and goblin at the rear The berserker is sniffing as they go and I wonder how much scent can actually tell him Can he smell the ores If so he s going to be a busy bear soon With the shifting nature of the labyrinth he ll probably be great at finding the actual path amp nbsp The changeling is drawing the map as they go while the goblin tries to keep their impatient charges from doing anything too stupid amp nbsp This is as fast as we can go he says in a tone that indicates it s not the first time he s had to repeat it with these guys and expects it won t be the last amp nbsp We can t let the others beat us to the ore complains what seems to be the lead dwarf though he has basically no accent at all We hired you to get us there as quickly as possible but this isn t even a jogging pace amp nbsp Do you charge around blindly in a new forge asks the changeling trying to keep annoyance out of his voice The three dwarves look scandalized at the very idea amp nbsp Of course not There s dangers in a forge if you re not careful amp nbsp What makes you think this is any less dangerous rumbles the bearkin his large club resting easily on his shoulder amp nbsp It s just a tunnel amp nbsp Inside a dungeon points out the goblin Even if this one is friendlier than most it s still a dungeon They re never more dangerous than when exploring a new area and even more so when it s explicitly said to be full of traps Speaking of have you managed to sniff any out Wold amp nbsp The bearkin apparently Wold shakes his head with a frown Nothing out of the ordinary yet I can smell a lot of mana around though Anything magical would be hard to pick out amp nbsp The goblin nods and lets his hand glide across the crystals in his belt before selecting one He gently taps it and speaks quietly though I can feel mana swirling around him as he does amp nbsp Brownie I have need of your aid Mana swirls around the crystal as the goblin holds his hand flat and a small figure coalesces It almost looks like loamy soil shaped into a pudgy humanoid form and finishes with a little green stocking cap Two small pebbles seem to form eyes and it makes strange noises at the goblin who shakes his head amp nbsp This would be torture for nixie you know that We re in a new place and there should be traps about I need you to help us find them I offer milk honey and bread as payment once we re back at the guild amp nbsp The brownie looks like it s deliberating the offer but there was no mistaking the look of naked desire in its pebbles when the food was mentioned It nods and hops off the hand and the goblin keeps the crystal held as the party continues amp nbsp I watch the little fey as they go the small thing moving around much faster than the others It catches the first alchemy trap which looks to be an itchbomb and the party decides to route around it It also catches a magical slowness trap which has me starting to get a bit worried It can spot my traps without too much difficulty which could put the whole concept of the labyrinth in danger amp nbsp I still think it s weird you have to pay your summons Gerlfi speaks the changeling eying the brownie as it points out another magical trap I mean you already convinced them to help you why do you have to keep convincing them amp nbsp Because they can still say no I don t create them I just transport a small part of them They still have their own motivations amp nbsp Hard binding angers the spirits rumbles the bearkin and Gerlfi nods amp nbsp Wold has the right of it They re fey not spirits but it s the same principle How would you like it Vieds if you were actually compelled to listen to my good advice asks the goblin with a smirk which the changeling returns amp nbsp It might not be so bad if you managed to actually give good advice once in a while Wold chuckles as Gerlfi pretends to be offended His retort is interrupted by the sound of the brownie finally missing a trap Wold and Vieds fall through the floor as it rotates and before they even land the trap slams back into place and clicks disabling it and separating the party amp nbsp Gerlfi steps forward before stopping himself not wanting to fall into the same trap and instead tries to raise his voice Vieds Wold Can you hear me Are you alright amp nbsp In the tunnel below the two groan at the unexpected fall but they haven t injured anything The changeling summons a small fireball to help light the area revealing the brownie is with them too Wold s ear twitches as he hears his goblin friend yelling and he looks upward as he shouts his own reply amp nbsp We re safe in a second tunnel I don t see an obvious way back amp nbsp Gerlfi looks relieved that his friends are safe but it doesn t take long for the reality of the situation to sink in Separated Great I m releasing the brownie he yells to his friends before severing the connection and causing the little fey to vanish with a small pop He somehow manages to keep from pointing out how much hurrying helped contribute to the predicament to the dwarves as he explains their options amp nbsp With us separated we should head back I can call on a more powerful fey if you really want to try to continue but I ll have to offer it a portion of what you mine That also assumes we won t trip into another trap before then amp nbsp But the ore insists the lead dwarf looking like he knows what he should do but has to fight with his greed to actually do it amp nbsp The goblin simply shrugs I think we re not getting it at least not today Right now the decision is if you want to walk out or be carried out amp nbsp And if we decide to press on amp nbsp Gerlfi shrugs again Then I think you ll be doing it without me I m not in the habit of continuing doomed contracts amp nbsp You can t do that exclaims the lead dwarf looking livid but the slow smile of the goblin stops his bluster in its tracks amp nbsp I can t Do you really want to argue the language of our deal with someone who contracts with fey amp nbsp The lead dwarf looks like he might but his companions seem a bit more level headed They clamp their hands over the loud one s mouth and shake their heads amp nbsp No No that s alright I think getting escorted back to the front gates now would be for the best No sense hammering burnt metal after all amp nbsp The goblin s smile grows much more warm and much less predatory Ah good I knew you were reasonable dwarves amp nbsp amp nbsp lt lt First https www reddit com r HFY comments sf fzj a strange opportunity lt Previous https www reddit com r HFY

        "cleaned_text": "If you re like most people you lock your door before going to bed at night It only makes sense the world is a dangerous place and you never know who or what might be lurking in the shadows Back when I was still brave enough to look out my window after dark I used to think about our ancestors huddled in caves wondering if more than just the wind was howling in the black night beyond their fire s comforting glow For me the most basic human trait isn t cooperation tribalism or even using tools It s fear Like you I lock my door at night to keep that darkness at bay But when I do I never ever look outside If you peer through the windows of your house or the peephole of your apartment after dark and I m not suggesting that you do you ll notice a few things right away The first is stillness if you re lucky After all there s no reason why someone or something should happen to be standing on your doorstep waiting for you to look outside Waiting to sneer at you through that thin barrier before they come crashing into your home do what they wish to you and the people you love You won t notice anything like that Probably If you re lucky What you will notice however are shadows It doesn t matter whether you re looking out at a carpeted hotel corridor a freshly trimmed green lawn or the ugly welcome mat of your neighbor across the hallway there will always be shadows And most of the time they behave themselves A shift in the shadows or a shadow where one shouldn t be That s the first sign that something is wrong but most people aren t paying enough attention to realize what s changed It s perfectly understandable Maybe you re still frustrated by an argument at work or exhausted from trying to bathe a fussy baby Given what we all go through every day why would you notice that the long black shadows of the trees in your yard are stretching toward the dying sunset instead of away from it Why would you think that the dark shape flickering above the elevator is anything other than a helpless moth trapped inside a wall lamp No after your quick peek outside you probably feel safe Content There are no unknown horrors on your porch No insanely grinning figures are creeping down your apartment hallway tiptoeing with impossible exaggerated strides There are no threats beyond your window the chain lock or the peephole None that you re aware of anyway If you re lucky there will be other more pronounced signs that a change is taking place If you re not well the shadows might be the only warning you get I was one of the lucky ones I had so many subtle hints that something wasn t right but like most people I didn t pay attention until it was too late I was twenty two that summer and I d just moved in with my friends Juan Paul and Cassandra The house was a gray two story rental on a floodplain beneath the railroad tracks It was nothing special but it was walking distance from our college and we could afford the rent As often happens with new roommates it took as awhile to get used to each others quirks Paul had an irritating habit of leaving half empty mugs and cups all over the house Juan was an early riser who completed his morning workout to pounding techno music and I m sure I had more than my share of personality flaws myself The only thing annoying about Cassandra however seemed to be just how superstitious she was She avoided ladders and black cats like the plague every time she spilled salt she tossed a pinch of it over her shoulder I considered asking her if she wore a pair of lucky socks to her exams but I decided that I was better off not knowing It was a windy night at the end of August Juan was on a date with a girl from our statistics class Paul had gone to some fundraiser for his fraternity and Cassie and I had been left alone in the house She was studying something at the kitchen table her frizzy auburn hair hanging over her face I had just come downstairs for a late night snack The wind might not even have been all that severe but in our rattling tin roofed rental house it seemed it Before I went to bed I at least wanted to see how bad it was What are you doing Cassandra stopped fiddling with her pen and looked up suddenly Uh checking outside I m about to lock the door and go to bed Well do one or the other Not both At first I thought I d missed something Then with my hand on the door I got a sinking feeling This was probably another one of Cassie s stupid superstitions Why shouldn t I do both I finally sighed It s something my grandmother said She used to say that there are wicked things out there in the dark searching for a pair of eyes to let them in There was a long pause Look I know it sounds stupid okay Just do it for me It did sound stupid and I also felt a sudden need to check on my car which was parked beneath a half dead sycamore across the street I figured Cassie would hear if I opened the door but a quick peek out the long side window while I turned the key in the lock couldn t hurt right It was a weird night The trees swayed from side to side like they were performing some kind of macabre dance below them plastic bags and newspapers blew by on the uneven sidewalk The ordinarily comforting glow of the streetlights suddenly looked orangish flickery and wrong But at least no branches had fallen on my car I smirked said goodnight to Cassie and went upstairs to bed Maybe it s just my contradictory nature but after Cassie more or less forbade us from looking outside when we locked the door I started finding more and more excuses to do so I had to check for a package I d left a drink on the porch I wasn t sure if I d left the outdoor lights on or not They all came down to the same thing trying to figure out just what it was about that evening ritual so familiar to everyone I knew that had Cassie so spooked Juan s theory was that the grandmother story was made up and that Cassie had been attacked while checking outside her door Paul who wasn t exactly a sensitive soul assumed that she had some kind of mental disorder I couldn t care less how crazy she is he sneered one night while Cassie was out as long as she pays her share of the rent on time The problem was Cassandra seemed less and less crazy to me with each passing day When I d check for deliveries before locking the door I d get an awful feeling that someone was watching me from the gloom below the trees across the street I d notice it again the way the streetlights would seem to dim and change color the way their shadows would reach out for me like long skeletal fingers The hair on the back of my neck would suddenly stand up but I was sure that there was no one there Just uneven sidewalks dewy grass dark silent houses and those somehow malevolent shadows that seemed to tilt the wrong way It got to the point that I didn t dare look up from the welcome mat when I checked for packages I was too terrified of who or what I might find suddenly standing in front of me I know I should talk to Cassie about what I was experiencing but part of me was still convinced that I had freaked myself out over nothing And another part the stubborn part just didn t want to admit that she had been right As it turned out Cassie was visiting a friend in another state when the danger began to deepen Once again I was alone in the house I had just turned the key when I heard a loud THUMP against the door I reversed the lock pulled open the handle And saw a dead bird laying on the welcome mat What the I was about to bend down and inspect it maybe even pick it up when I saw the figure in the corner of the porch Even now I couldn t say for sure whether it was a person a monster or just a trick of the light Whatever it was it was bulky dark and over six feet tall I remember something that could have been a leathery wings or maybe just a black trenchcoat scarred bloated skin like a drowning victim s round hungry horribly human eyes I screamed and ran back inside but no monstrous hand reached through the doorway after me The neighbor s pit bull barked a light flashed on in the house across the street but otherwise the night was silent There was no sign of whatever I d seen out there I turned the key in the lock with a shaking hand and hauled myself upstairs I didn t dare to look out the window a second time I d barely reached my bedroom when a massive SLAM sent the front door flying open Heavy footsteps creaked across the floor down below A hand bashed into the wall feeling for something maybe the lightswitch I froze too scared to breathe and heard giggling Juan and his girlfriend Adriana drunk and trying to find their way to his bedroom He shushed her warning her that his roommate was asleep but that only made her giggle harder I let out a sigh of relief and climbed into bed The next morning Juan made breakfast for the three of us My fears felt foolish in the bright morning light but something was different about Juan He watched me out of the corner of my eye as I ate like there was something he wanted to tell me When Adriana finally scurried off to the bathroom he leaned over and asked in a low voice if I knew the big guy who d been standing on our porch the night before Later in my bedroom I noticed a pair of massive greasy handprints on my window That night I did the opposite of what I should have After sunset I left the porch light on obsessively peering the long narrow window beside the door each time I passed Nothing nothing and more nothing A distant rumble of thunder announced the arrival of a late summer storm Paul was upstairs catching up on Chemistry homework Juan was taking a shower As the rain began to fall I felt very very alone I hadn t told the others about what I was going through I had mentioned something about a suspicious character who I d seen hanging around the house but left it at that The truth was I would have taken any explanation a stalker a prank or even that I was going crazy rather than believe that any of it was really happening I checked out the narrow doorside window yet again it was hard to see in the dark and rain Wait Dark Rain What about the porch light A huge horrible eye blinked back at me The face it belonged to was large enough to take up the entire window blocking out the light I fell backwards with a shriek Running footsteps Juan naked except for a towel wrapped around his waist Paul pale and irritated that I d broken his concentration I stammered something about some guy on the porch But of course there was no one there when Juan opened the door one fist around his tiny towel the other up in the air like he was ready to fight the devil with it Just my luck to move in with a bunch of nutcases Paul muttered under his breath and stomped back to his room Juan shot me a worried look then closed the door and locked it Still shaking I went back to my room and sat in the dark my fist white knuckle tight around the baseball bat that was the closest thing to a weapon that I owned I thought seriously about trying to buy a gun but background checks in my state take at least forty eight hours and I wasn t sure that I had that long And what about Cassie I should have thought of it before She was the one who had mentioned the weird superstition in the first place maybe she would have some idea what was going on I pulled out my phone and gave her a call then another She didn t pick up I wasn t surprised she was probably enjoying a night out with the friends she was visiting Outside the rain fell harder crashing in torrents against our rental s tin roof In other circumstances it might have been a soothing sound but not being able to hear what was going on in the rest of the house was making me nervous With my hands still wrapped around my baseball bat I lay down on my bed and waited for what would come next The buzz of my phone jarred me from sleep so roughly that I nearly hit myself in the face with my own makeshift weapon Cassie I picked up right away Hey You called Rumbling voices announcements over an intercom She was in public transport somewhere and her voice sounded like it was echoing down a tunnel I don t think she understood my incoherent explanation of the strange events around our house but she could hear the fear in my voice For a long moment I heard nothing but background noise I m sorry Cassie said like a doctor giving a terminal diagnosis If it s gotten that far then it s already too late Downstairs the doorbell rang I double checked my phone screen It was after three AM No one should have been visiting that late and yet Sounds of movement Juan He was actually going to answer it I gotta go I told Cassie But it was already too late Adriana Juan muttered downstairs What are you doing here I couldn t see what was happening but I could imagine it Juan half asleep a dark shape that looked like his rain drenched girlfriend shivering on our porch lit only from behind by streetlights He opened the door just as I shouted out a warning Two heartbeats later it swung shut on its own We never saw him again Cassandra didn t come back to the house after that Her scanty secondhand possessions were worth next to nothing and gave us no clue of who she d been or where we d come from The college refused to help with our search Her information was private if there were no signs of foul play she would simply be filed away with all the countless other students who had suddenly dropped out with no notification for reasons of their own The local police meanwhile acted completely unconcerned about Juan s disappearance During the smoke break they took on our porch I overheard them joking about how my med student roommate had probably just been deported I moved out too of course I cared more about avoiding the next horror that might happen in that house than I did about breaking a lease and I crashed on couches until I found a free room Paul continued living in the rental muttering about broken promises and New Age crazies Eventually he got new roommates and to the best of my knowledge none of them ever looked out the window before locking the door Since then neither have I There have been a few close calls Sudden sounds that come from just outside my door almost shocking enough to make me press my eye to the peephole Other nights the bell will ring the moment I slide the key into the lock like something out there is teasing me The worst though are the voices Juan s An elderly woman who I can only assume was Cassie s grandmother Voices that call my name sweetly from the dark asking me if anyone s home X https www reddit com r beardify"

something about the fans Kpop groups are well known for having legions of incredibly dedicated fans who are willing to go above and beyond for their idols One thing that brings a lot of fans of the same group together is shipping If you re not familiar with the concept of shipping I m honestly impressed The kind of shipping we ll be talking about here is the shipping of real people also known as RPF In Kpop this usually manifests as fans really liking the relationship between two usually male K pop idols and then thinking they should fuck There s a lot of popular Kpop ships out there and they all have their own devoted group of supporters But today we re gonna be talking about the Kpop ship that would go on to define Kpop fanservice fandom and shipping for the next two decades Yunjae

to as Dong Bang Shin Ki or DBSK In Japan they are known as Tohoshinki or THSK All of these names mean the same thing and for consistency s sake I ll just be referring to them as TVXQ throughout this

of the kind of fanbase they re known for being Cassies are constantly fighting even now TVXQ debuted under the company SM Entertainment which is known as one of the big entertainment companies in Kpop What you need to know about SM is they have resources connections and a very unfortunate eye for talent In order to debut each member of TVXQ had to sign a contract with SM agreeing to certain terms for a certain length of time Okay that s enough info dumping Let s talk about what we came here for gay ship fandom drama Let s talk about Yunjae The Beginning of an Era Yunjae is the ship name of TVXQ members Yunho https i imgur com fLLy Us jpg and Jaejoong https i imgur com x izCZR jpg Jaejoong and Yunho are the two oldest members of TVXQ respectively with their birthdays being just days apart Jaejoong and Yunho had already been good friends prior to their debut in TVXQ which is not always the case in Kpop There s a lot of stories about how Yunho and Jaejoong originally met with the most popular one claiming that they first encountered each other in a street fight However I have been able to find no evidence of this in English at least so it s most likely just a rumor Regardless of how they met the important thing is that Yunho and Jaejoong were already friendly and close with each other when TVXQ was debuting And at a time when most of the other members were still a bit awkward with each other Yunjae s level of comfort with each other https imgur com RVTbMxt really stood out to people Fans rapidly picked up on their closeness https imgur com Hdqf wG which wasn t hard when you had incidents like Jaejoong kissing Yunho on the cheek on broadcast https media tenor com rlRCGubqs gAAAAM angai yunjae gif in early Things quickly spiraled from there as fans began to latch on to every subsequent interaction Yunho and Jaejoong would have with each other From late when they released their first album Tri angle which featured some truly unfortunate styling https imgur com a DlxVsfL through the release of their second album Rising Sun https imgur com a ScuKnx at the end of Yunjae continued to grow in popularity as a ship Fansites were beginning to pop up devoted exclusively to talking about Yunjae capturing Yunjae moments and stalking Yunjae There s two very notable fanbases that are going to be important Yoonjaepaetch YJP the largest Korean based Yunjae fansite and YoonJaeLoveBar YJLB based out of China and the largest Yunjae fansite by far These fansites became cornerstones of the fandom because they had by far the most access to resources and had the most ability to get photos of Yunjae All the while Yunho and Jaejoong continued to interact relatively normally with each other They just happened to be two guys in a group who were very comfortable with each other Their dynamic at this point was frequently characterized as them being the mom and dad of the group due to Jaejoong s love for cooking and Yunho being the leader of the group Nothing insane Yet TVXQ was becoming increasingly popular throughout this which means that by the end of Yunjae had become a somewhat well known ship in Kpop Shipping in Kpop wasn t unheard of before this and there had been fan favorite ships before Yunjae but these ships had nothing on what Yunjae was about to become Where Things Get Real The year The event a competition hosted by SM entertainment to find the best TVXQ fanfiction The prize million won the possibility for the winner s fanfiction to become a live action drama and a date with TVXQ themselves Yes you heard that right starts with SM hosting an official fanfiction competition where the grand prize was a date with the guys who the fanfiction was about https www reddit com r kpopthoughts comments n aja sm fanfic contest no it actually happened utm source share amp utm medium web x amp context Am I the only one who thinks that s an incredibly bad idea Just me We never found out how that went but I can only assume the answer is terribly for everyone involved Anyways the existence of this competition shows that by early SM was catching on to the growing popularity of Yunjae or at least shipping in general Realizing that it was drawing a lot of new people into the group SM did the only logical thing a corporation in a homophobic country in the mid s could do immediately milk Yunjae for all it was worth This is how Dangerous Love came to be What s Dangerous Love Dangerous Love is half the reason I wanted to write this thing in the first place Dangerous Love is a fever dream Dangerous Love changed

you who don t want to watch a minute long episode in Korean I ll try to sum up the plot Yunho shows Jaejoong gay fanfiction of the two of them Dangerous Love has TVXQ acting as themselves Jaejoong reads the gay fanfiction Jaejoong imagines himself and Yunho as he reads the gay fanfiction If you watch a single thing from Dangerous Love watch this https youtu be jiP rZ TeI si Qj kDH g Te o A amp t Afterwards Yunho starts being weirdly nice to Jaejoong convincing Jaejoong that Yunho is gay for him The rest of the episode consists of Yunho being nice while Jaejoong is unable to think of anything but him and Yunho being gay together Sexy music plays every time they interact from now on Yunho tells Jaejoong that he needs to confess something to him Jaejoong cuts him off tells him he understands his feelings and then gives him the world s least intimate hug This confuses Yunho because he is not in fact gay for Jaejoong He s been acting nice because he broke Jaejoong s new camera Jaejoong cusses him out chases him around everyone laughs and the episode ends with no actual gay wrongs having been committed That s Dangerous Love This would be insane to film and air anywhere in South Korea in but just to make sure we are all on the same page about how absurd this is I need to clarify that Dangerous Love aired on national television On a Sunday morning in a timeslot that was consistently the most watched program on Sundays in the nation Dangerous Love aired to viewership https en wikipedia org wiki Good Sunday useskin vector Millions of people moms dads grandparents watched this gay episode when it aired on TV Let s circle back to the part where real life Yunho and Jaejoong have to act out a gay fanfiction of the two of them Do you notice the red phone booth Yunho pushes Jaejoong up against https imgur com a I NqAaA Thanks to Dangerous Love red phonebooths have since become highly associated with Yunjae https oyunjae tumblr com post EC E AC EC A EC EC D B EC EC EB EC E EB B A jaejoong ah in here to the point where fans have cosplayed as one to one of Jaejoong s concerts https yunjaepouch tumblr com post oyunjae the red phone booth jaejoong chose hahaha After this when people thought of TVXQ a lot of them would then think about Yunjae SM was promoting this ship on a national level And it was working Dangerous Love was the spark that would ignite the Yunjae Yaoi Inferno of The Yunjae Yaoi Inferno of Dangerous Love has aired and SM has realized they have a verifiable cash cow on their hands in the form of Yunjae So they start pushing Yunjae and pushing it hard Pushing a ship refers to when a higher power TV show writers authors CEO of SM ex international fugitive https www asianjunkie com wp content uploads LeeSooManSuhSeWonInterpol jpg Lee Sooman heavily promote and take steps to try and make a pairing a fan favorite In Kpop in particular this usually manifests in idols being told to up the fanservice and skinship with each other And the reason they are told to do this and the ways in which they are told to do this stem from the way Yunjae began to interact from this point on Because holy shit did the amount of touching https i pinimg com originals bd e ad bd ead afaa c d e c e bcba gif looking https media tenor com YcQVrPNfj AAAAM angai dbsk gif and suggestive comments between Yunho and Jaejoong escalate during this year And yes it s obvious that a lot of this was instigated by SM telling them to amp up the fanservice https rawrboysmodemedia files wordpress com e aad gif The thing is that it was also obvious that not all of it was just fanservice The reason Yunjae grew so popular was because it wasn t all just for show you could tell Yunho and Jaejoong genuinely cared about each other as people and as friends on and off camera So now you have amped up fanservice on camera combined with acts done off camera that can be used to argue it s not all for show and you have a recipe for a whole bunch of fans who genuinely and sincerely believe Yunjae are a real thing Not every shipper truly believes that their ship is actually dating behind the scenes and I d say these days those fans are in the majority People ship now because they like dynamics like to imagine what could happen if they were dating This was not the case with Yunjae This was never the case with Yunjae And why wouldn t it be when in alone you had The aforementioned Dangerous Love Yunho and Jaejoong doing whatever this is https youtu be se opm nVPQ si MIJba F uJOFpL amp t on national TV Grinding while hanging from monkey bars is

hug yun jae gif of the aforementioned touching and looking https twitter com i status Like this is nowhere near all of it I ve been trying to avoid video links but just know that if you search Yunjae moment on YouTube at least half are going to be from this year alone It was rumored that Yunho picked Jaejoong up from the police station after Jaejoong had a DUI https forums soompi com topic jaejoong gets caught for drunk driving his only one to date I should add This was another case where I could not find any solid English proof beyond a single photo https i photobucket com albums h azn lil babe YunJaeHo Candid jpg and a lot of people repeating the same thing so take that with a grain of salt Gashiyeon Actually I need to talk about Gashiyeon Because Gashiyeon is the other of why I wanted to make this writeup And it only took me a couple thousand words to get there Interlude it s you the beauty from class What is Gashiyeon Gashiyeon is a Yunjae fanfiction written in Korean by an author known as Maio Gashiyeon directly translates to thorn lily but the fic is better known in English as thorn year I m going to keep calling it Gashiyeon because that s what I ve always known it as Gashiyeon was published throughout the course of and consists of three parts Reduced Horizons the prequel Thorn Lily the main story and Fox s Cradle the sequel The three parts all take place years from each other making Gashiyeon a coming of age slash melodrama slash psychological horror Although I don t think the last one was intentional That s just how I felt reading it I don t read RPF as a general rule but this fanfic is so far removed from reality reading it felt like I had been transported to an alternate dimension Why do we care about Gashiyeon Because Gashiyeon was a smash hit Gashiyeon became insanely popular amongst Korean Cassiopeias Obviously Gashiyeon was not one of the first Yunjae fanfictions out there nor was it one of the longest at that point but it became the most well known one Gashiyeon became well known and adored for three things because of its writing style its plot and its characterization And it ended up influencing Cassiopeia Yunjae shippers and Yunjae themselves in ways that are still visible today The writing style and plot are the two most important factors in why it got popular so let s get them out of the way first According to those who have read it in the original Korean it is written absolutely beautifully It supposedly has amazing prose descriptive imagery and is rife with symbolism and metaphor I read translations https egashiyeon livejournal com that were kindly done by fans https honeyiceblend livejournal com html for free and so for me to say anything about the prose would be out of line I have not read it in the original Korean and so I have not been able to verify if it s true that Gashiyeon is written masterfully Even if it was though not even the best written prose would be able to fix the absolute nightmare that is the plot of Gashiyeon To conceptualize the plot of Gashiyeon think of the most toxic mid s yaoi manga anime story you have ever encountered If that is not something you have had the misfortune of experiencing think of Twilight except written in a way where everyone is significantly more deranged and with much more awful sex Now take either or both of those things and combine them with wisdom teeth incest eggs toe sucking sandwich innuendos first degree homicide and second degree homicide and you ll have a rough idea of what the plot of Gashiyeon is Except that story would still be better by virtue of not being Gashiyeon I cannot talk more about the plot without going on a multi thousand word rant so instead I will leave you with this tumblr post https yoonje tumblr com post and this review https www asianfanfics com blog view of Gashiyeon Anyways if you read those posts you ll notice that they describe the characters somewhat Which brings us to our next point the characterization Gashiyeon s characterization to put it lightly fucking sucks Look there s always going to be issues when you re writing fanfiction about real people They re real people first of all and it s hard to boil down real living breathing people with all their quirks and flaws to the kind of D character archetypes fanfiction so often demands It s even harder to do so while still keeping the characterized version true to the real person s personality But no part of Gashiyeon s characterization is in any way shape or form based in reality I used the s yaoi analogy earlier and if you re familiar with the typical toxic seme uke dynamic it s essentially that but on steroids If you re not don t worry because I m about to explain our characters Jaejoong as a real life human is a complicated man He says whatever is on his mind https www youtube com watch v cGV LTX rk he s prone to questionable tattoo choices and impulse decisions and he recently named his fans boss babies https www youtube com watch v ZHuEBH lrYg But he is also an incredibly caring person down to his core feels incredibly deeply and passionately and is a talented singer and songwriter https www youtube

com i status its so cute don t call him a baby https twitter com i status though Gashiyeon Jaejoong on the other hand pushes Yunho s mom down a flight of stairs Later he pushes Yunho s pregnant wife down another flight of stairs Separate incidents ten years apart No regrets either He s incredibly self centered an overdramatic diva and a bitch He successfully convinces Yunho to cheat on his pregnant wife with him repeatedly He s petty demanding and his love obsession with Yunho is his defining trait here He s primarily the way that he is because of manipulation from Yunho and in turn manipulates him back He dies at the end from an ass bleed that makes him so upset cw gt suicide lt gt it leads to him slitting his wrists and bleeding out in a bathtub lt Yunho in real life is also a complicated man by virtue of being a person He s incredibly dedicated in everything he does is known amongst people at SM for cornering artists and giving them advice for hours at a time https tvxqexpress com trans yunhos advice time mentioned in happy together episode featuring fellow sm artists if left unchecked and is fiercely competitive and passionate https www soompi com article wpp tvxqs yunho reveals actually thinks passionate sm He s unerringly loyal sometimes to a fault struggled immensely during his time as a trainee and is known for going out of his way to help others on a

love with him instead of Yunho He s a manipulative bastard cheats on his pregnant wife and lies to her about it and has beat the shit out of Jaejoong multiple times He verbally abuses and gaslights Jaejoong and in the prequel realizes he has created a monster via his manipulation and abuse and just abandons Jaejoong and leaves him to get kidnapped Jaejoong killing his mother and wife is not enough to stop him from getting some He chooses Jaejoong over his own child time and time again Yunho also dies at the end from cw gt suicide lt gt hanging himself on the day of his anniversary with Jaejoong because why the fuck not lt To give Gashiyeon credit I m positive it is in no way the first fic to have this type of characterization But it is by far the one that had the most impact and also sucks and I suffered through all of it so I get to shit on it all I want This characterization could work if it was executed well but it s not But yeah you get the point The Yunho and Jaejoong of Gashiyeon are so far removed from reality they might as well just be named Joe and Bob for all that it matters That didn t matter to the readers though because they loved it and soon enough the prevailing way people saw Jaejoong and Yunho were high maintenance jealous bottom with no personality other than being obsessed with Yunho and possessive overbearing top respectively Gashiyeon s impact To put it bluntly this fic is responsible for one of the worst fandom feedback loops I know of one which still impacts Cassiopeia to this day Regardless of how or why it happened Gashiyeon became very very famous Famous enough to become as close to mandatory reading as you can get in a fandom The majority of Yunjae shippers at the time especially the Korean ones read Gashiyeon And they took the way Gashiyeon characterized Yunho and Jaejoong and made it their bible This was the lens they were going to view Yunjae through from then on until the end of time Of course this characterization then begins to pop up in other fics So then even if you haven t read Gashiyeon you ve read these other fics and so then you start to see them that way And so on and so forth This is unfortunate but at least it s just a fandom thing and doesn t impact the actual people right Wrong Someone at SM must have caught wind of the fact that these traits were what people wanted to see in Yunjae and as a result Yunjae began to play into those tropes Not to an extreme extent by any means but you ll notice that a lot of the clips people have labeled with jealous jaejoong https www youtube com watch v E KhLBmc x or possessive yunho https www youtube com watch v xwg vhd Cn happen beginning in late early Some of this spike in popularity is because fans were now looking out for anything that matched these behaviors Though in comparing some of these interactions to earlier ones you can see Yunjae playing into the tropes https www youtube com watch v v jjH cOLIY in ways that they hadn t before It s a mixture of both with one influencing the other Of course them playing into it only encouraged fans to keep writing and interpreting their behavior like that and thus those stereotypes of them have prevailed even to this day where you still see people reducing Yunjae to those cores Jaejoong in particular because he kind of got the short end of the stick here And in a lot of other ways but that s a later thing The idea of the high maintenance bitchy bottom would eventually evolve and go on to become a trope of the designated bottom of male kpop idol ships who would constantly get labeled as jealous https lets talk baekyeol tumblr com post jealousbaekhyun and petty divas https www youtube com watch v D OLqQMWxQ This stereotyping existed in other spheres long before this but it was Gashiyeon that really brought the trope to Kpop and gave it staying power there Luckily as far as I can tell it seems to have died down recently I m not really involved with recent Kpop groups or any shipping that takes place there though Instead I spend my time writing thousands of words on people from the s I don t even ship Like a well adjusted normal person How big was Gashiyeon really There were three editions https blog naver com surfacebook of hard copies of Gashiyeon published and distributed they weren t officially published by a company but produced by the author The most damning sign of the influence Gashiyeon had is that Jaejoong himself seemed to know of it Someone allegedly asked Jaejoong if he had read Gashiyeon and he responded with isn t that one erotic implying that he knew something of Gashiyeon I however cannot confirm this beyond old screenshots which could very easily be doctored https x com Sarangjoongie status s Given that Jaejoong and Yunho would later go on to admit to reading mpreg fic of the two of them it wouldn t be off brand for him to know of it And as one more point to illustrate how well known Gashiyeon was years later veteran Kpop group H O T would guest on SNL Korea and act out a sketch that is heavily implied to be about Gashiyeon https www youtube com watch v pc MH l Like they straight up quote it This is like if NSYNC went on SNL and did a sketch where they acted out One Direction fanfiction And also if one of the members of one direction had previously been so distraught about NSYNC breaking up that he posted on Instagram saying he had nothing left to live for Because that is in fact what teenage Jaejoong did when H O T disbanded https imgur com a wS ituH making it extra funny that they re the ones acting out this fanfiction about him But now I m done talking about Gashiyeon we have covered the major Yunjae events of and we are ready to end the year with TVXQ in fursuits singing about depression https www youtube com watch v MTfuyxgdCW as one does So let s move on to Because if you thought we were anywhere close to being done with this rollercoaster you d be wrong The Eye of the Yunjae Hurricane So throughout all of this TVXQ have been promoting in Japan as Tohoshinki on top of and in between their yearly Korean comebacks SM sent them over in with no ability to speak Japanese zero translators almost no support and had them singing in stairwells and in half filled conference rooms Somehow this worked and paid off and by TVXQ was a big fucking deal in Japan They were topping the charts something only done once before by a Korean artist in Japan BoA Japan is much more profitable to make music in compared to South Korea because you can do significantly more concerts there So it s not uncommon these days for Kpop groups to have random Japanese releases to try and cash in on that market While second gen groups like KARA SHINee Big Bang and SNSD would gain significant popularity in Japan nobody who has come after TVXQ has ever been able to do so to the extent that they have It got to the point where many people in the general public were unaware they were a Korean group at all only knowing them as Tohoshinki SM has them spend all of in Japan doing concert tours and releasing singles and not seeing their family This meant a sharp decrease in the amount of Yunjae content coming out from fansites as the majority of sites did not have the money to drop everything and go to Japan to take photos of TVXQ Some did looking at you YJLB but most didn t especially because Japanese concerts tend to have much stricter rules about photography than Korean concerts do TVXQ were still promoting and appearing on TV in Japan so people were still able to get their Yunjae fix that way Not a lot occurred in terms of Korean Yunjae drama in though which means now is as good of a time as ever to talk about the fansites a bit more This isn t related to Yunjae as much it is just interesting to me but it does help put the hobby in this drama post There were a lot of fanbooks and published fanfiction for TVXQ I m not talking like doujins or zines I mean big fat chunky hardcover books You could have literal shelves https blog naver com xkarmr full of TVXQ fanbooks fanfiction Some were hardcover copies of fanfictions that had been published online already like with Gashiyeon Others were compilations put out by the fansites themselves For example every year YJP would put out an anniversary book https search pstatic net common src http A F Fblogfiles naver net Fdata F F F F Fdsc feolia jpg amp type sc containing fics artwork https search pstatic net common src http A F Fcafefiles naver net Fdata F F F F F BB E C F rosa jpg amp type sc and fantaken photos that were exclusive to the books themselves and not published online Coming from an era where everything is digital and there s not nearly as many hard copies of fanbooks being made I just think it s really fucking cool that this was a thing I found out a lot about Korean Cassie fan culture and what the major influential fanworks and fansites were in Korea at the time through the process of looking up some of these books and then encountering people talk about them on forum posts made back in the day Also the two biggest Yunjae sites I mentioned earlier YJP and YJLB hated each other YJP and YJLB both had hard bans on posting photos from the other fansite on their respective sites I don t know for sure if it went both ways because YJP s site is now defunct but from what I saw on other sites there was definite bad blood between the two fansites which continued until YJP s demise making YJLB the winner of that particular fandom war Anyways this has been a fun detour but we should probably check back in with Yunjae Surely nothing insane has happened while we were gone and oh They are now married Okay Well married heavy on the quotes On June th during an episode of the radio show they hosted in Japan called BIGEASTATION Yunho and Jaejoong were asked which member of TVXQ they d choose to marry if they had to https youtu be u l bQYHUic Completely unsurprisingly they chose each other and joked that they were now a happily married couple Poor Junsu was also there and just had to bear witness to this happening in front of him Obviously Yunjae fans went fucking insane at this and the day became known as their wedding anniversary and shippers still celebrate it to this day https twitter com hashtag Yunjae thAnniversary src hashtag click Like this day is taken incredibly seriously Much less so now than a decade ago but the Yunjae anniversary is sacred to Yunjae shippers all the same Overall though consists mostly of continuation of the theme of fanservice with hints of more https favim com pd s orig jaejoong yunho yunjae Favim com gif just in Japan instead of Korea this time The number of Cassieopeia and Yunjae shippers are still continuing to rise and

        "cleaned_text": "Something I ve been theorizing wondering about for a while especially with re reads of HBP and DHs What if Hermione sent her parents away before the summer after HBP What if she sent them away a year or two earlier and nobody realizes because the Grangers are very much disconnected from the Wizarding World by being Muggles TLDR Hermione could have sent her parents away as early as the summer after th Year but didn t say anything until DHs when the topic of her parents came up and she had to explain to Harry and Ron Hermione had to have realized what grave danger her parents were in starting after GoF and Voldemort s return This is in the summer of Our perception of the books timeline can be clouded if you read the original run and there was up to three years between publications but internally the breaks between books are somewhere around weeks from the time when Harry finishes a school year to when he gets to leave the Dursleys Hermione is already at Grimmauld Place when Harry gets there in OotP During the Christmas break of OotP she arrives by the Knight Bus after Mr Weasley s attack which always came off as strange to me because if she didn t go on holiday with her parents but went home from Hogwarts wouldn t they have brought her by car to London and then she could get to Grimmauld Place on her own They don t Hermione very much seems to have snuck out of Hogwarts and got to Grimmauld Place on her own which would make sense as she using Wizarding transport to arrive to another place in the Wizarding World This is what made me think that she might not have been anywhere near her parents but only said that because she was and still underaged in the Wizarding World Hermione also does not go home for Easter At this point she has not seen her parents maybe since Christmas and if not Christmas she had definitely has not seen them since the end of GoF when they ended th Year Again she appears to spend a very short amount of time with them before going to Grimmauld Place and being there for a while before Harry gets there by the opening of OotP By the summer holidays of right before their th Year she is again already at The Burrow when Harry arrives and this is WAY earlier in the summer than he usually arrives Strange again Doesn t she want to see her parents Summer is the most significant break she gets and she s away at a boarding school for most of the year in a world her parents aren t a part of Not to mention Wouldn t her parents want to keep her home and resting or maybe be reluctant to let her go back to the Wizarding World so soon after being hurt that badly the Department of Mysteries which JUST HAPPENED a couple of weeks earlier From our perspective HBP was published years after OOTP but again internally not that much time had passed She does appear to go home for Christmas in HBP but by this time Hermione is and a legal adult in the Wizarding World Who says she went home There would be nobody that could make her return to her Muggle parents custody Does anyone verify this by seeing meeting the Grangers on the platform Do we hear anything about them except Hermione has gone home for the holiday and is not at The Burrow She might have stayed in Hogsmeade or Diagon Alley for all we know and just told someone she was going back home Then she doesn t go home for Easter and then the end of HBP happens which is when we presume that she put the plan to send her parents away into motion But really do we really know that the Grangers weren t bewitched and sent away well before the summer of when she finally says this to Harry and Ron This is a child who brew Polyjuice Potion at years old I don t believe at all that a complex memory spell would have been out of her wheelhouse at years old As well Muggles can t just go to another country and set up a life in a few days like a wizard might be able to They would have had to apply for some type of immigration permission up to a whole year or maybe years and although they are very likely to have been approved by being dentist the process doesn t speed up or lose steps because a Muggleborn child needs it to What thoughts to you all have on this I m VERY interested to see if anyone feels this is possible or has at least speculated on this line of thought like I have been for a while"

        "cleaned_text": "Boomers just had a super good time for a couple of decades because of circumstances that we can t repeat and many people in the US really struggle to wrap their heads around this notion A large and affluent middle class is the cornerstone of the American dream A dream in which anyone with a high school diploma and hard work should easily afford a nice house in the suburbs cars and a nice vacation with the family to a cool place once a year Americans assume that this is the way the universe should work That things were always like this and that Americans have the God given right of the American dream However this reality of a exceptionally wealthy and prosperous middle class by global standards is NOT the norm or the natural way of things but a by product of a very unique and relatively recent set of historical circumstances specifically the end of World War II At the end of the second world war the US was the only major industrial power left with its industry and infrastructure unscathed This gave the US a dramatic economic advantage over the rest of the world as all other nations had to buy pretty much everything they needed from the US and use their cheap natural resources as a form of payment After the end of world War II pretty anywhere in the world if you needed tools machines vehicles capital goods aircraft etc you had little choice but to buy American So money flowed from all over the world into American businesses But the the owners of those businesses had to negotiate labor deals with the American relatively small and highly skilled workforce And since the owners of capital had no one else they could hire to men the factories many concessions had to be given to the labor unions This allowed for the phenomenal growth and prosperity of the US middle class we saw in the s and s White picket fence houses in the suburbs with large family cars parked in front was the norm for anyone who worked hard in the many factories and businesses that dotted the American landscape back then However over time the other industrial powers rebuild themselves and started to compete with the US German and Japanese cars Belgian and British steel Dutch electronics and French tools started to enter the world market and compete with American companies for market share Not only that but countries like Brazil South Africa India China Mexico Thailand Turkey South Korea and more also became industrialized This meant that they were no longer selling their natural resources cheaply in exchange for US made industrial goods Quite the contrary they themselves started to bid against the US for natural resources to fuel their own industries And more importantly the US work force no longer was the only one qualified to work on modern factories and to have proficiency over modern industrial processes An Australian airline needs a new commercial jet Brazil s EMBRAER https www youtube com watch v C m yRBkg and European Airbus can offer you products as good as anything made in the US Need power tools or a pickup truck You can buy American but you can also buy South Korean Indian or Turkish This meant that the US middle class could no longer easily outbid pretty much everyone else for natural resources and the owners of the capital and means of production no longer were held hostage by this small and highly skilled workforce Many other countries now had an industrial base that rivals or surpasses that of the US And they had their own middle classes that are bidding against the US middle class for those limited natural resources And manufacturers now could engage in global wage arbitrage by moving production to a country with cheaper labor which killed all the bargaining power of the unions If everyone in the world lived and consumed like what the average American sees as a reasonable middle class lifestyle i e drive an F or an SUV families with multiple cars living in a house in the suburbs high meat consumption etc it would take Earths to provide enough resources to sustain that lifestyle https www bbc com news magazine But we don t have Earths we have just one And unlike before the USA no longer can outbid the rest of the world for those limited resources GRAPH The U S Share of the Global Economy Over Time https www visualcapitalist com u s share of global economy over time That is where the decline of the US middle class is coming from There are no political solutions for it as no one not even Trump s protectionism or the Democrat s Unions can put the globalization genie back into a bottle It is the way it is Any politician who claims to be able to restore the good old days is lying So yes the old middle class lifestyle of big house big car all you can eat buffet shop until you drop while golfing on green grass fields located in the middle of the desert is not coming back no matter what your politician on either side of the isle promised you We are going back to the normal where the US middle class is not that different from the middle classes from the rest of the world Like a return to what middle class expectations are elsewhere including the likes of Europe Japan South Korea and Malaysia Their cars are smaller They don t change cars as often The whole family might share a single car Some families don t even own a car and rely on public transportation instead Their homes are smaller They don t eat as much meat and their food portions are smaller They are not starving They are not living like peasants But their standard of living is lower than what we in the US have considered a middle class lifestyle since the end of World War II Now that is not to say that there isn t a lot of inequality in the US or to deny that policies are needed to address that inequality But my issue with most of the give us equality folks in the US is that they imagine the rich being taxed so that they can finally afford that house in the burbs and the F in the driveway like their parents were able to That is NOT going to happen for the reasons I ve already explained No amount of taxation and public policy will make that happen That version of the middle class is never coming back Where I see public policy for wealth redistribution having an active and effective role is making healthcare more affordable making the cities more walkable and livable so that young Americans can transition from the suburbs to smaller and more affordable homes in dense urban neighborhoods where cars are not a basic necessity to earn income Our middle class will become more like other countries middle classes That cannot be changed What we can aim for is having our social services and social safety nets more in line to what exits and is available for the middle classes of those other countries"

        "cleaned_text": "First https www reddit com r HFY comments nfsakq out of cruel space part The Pirates Jean Luc you said that it was a joke Victor notes calmly even as he tries not to gawk at the fact that Jean Luc does in fact have an overabundance of butter An overabundance of butter that he has in fact shipped over to Shellgather in order to encourage a feast and promote a product That and apparently Jean Luc wanted some for himself so he was showing up with an ingredient The joke is that it s possible to have too much butter It s not Jean Luc says and Victor huffs in frustration but welcomes the man s presence regardless Apparently the violent Frenchman was more offended at the lack of good food than he had been publicly letting on as he had apparently been funding a huge amount of efforts to make a mass amount of human tasting foods that non humans could actually eat without spontaneously combusting or going into mass organ failure Apparently Garlic Butter was his latest smash success that he had been too busy selling to actually crow about Victor is going to have to ask for a look at Jean Luc s profit margins if selling food is better than selling medicine he s going to have to shift his focus on things ever so slightly Of course there s always the consideration that a market can easily get over saturated The butter is warmed and the Deep Scuttler that he killed has all it s limbs torn off to be boiled in different pots There s a bit of a mess as he helps peel away the shell around the main body and finds that although the organs of a Deep Scuttler can be best described as simple they re still in a shattered state due to his kicks and need to be literally hosed away before it can be eaten The main body goes on a grill over an open flame as Jean Luc is painting it with a bucket of his garlic butter and adding all sorts of little extras that add flavour without actually hurting anyone The legs and claws merrily boil away and the brown of the shell turns a bright cherry red The feast is small more a snack really as one Deep Scuttler for an entire town is slim pickings But everyone gets a taste at least and Jean Luc promptly gets himself numerous requests for the butter and he passes out numerous pamphlets and little brochures of the products he s selling Well played on his part especially as the butter had made the meal The Deep Scuttler hadn t had much taste of it s own but carried taste like an absolute champion and had a wonderful texture So what do you think Tasty Should we add hunting Deep Scuttlers to the list of products Besides the fact that they re very powerful and dangerous Absurd supersoldier silliness that you can do aside my lord they re the prey of the Mirage Whales I don t want to potentially upset a being so large that it can be walked upon by a whole family while it sleeps with it s nose in the air Beatrice says sand Victor can nod at that logic That said it may be wise to have a few locals start training up to an Undaunted Level I understand it seems heh daunting But it is worthwhile Victor notes Is it true that you recruit only men Beatrice asks and Victor blinks No but we do give preferable treatment to men that sign up This is mostly because for humans men are the warriors and hunters but also in that many men lack direction and purpose in the galaxy at large Time in the military is many things purposeless is not one of them Victor says Would you be willing to train apprentices She asks and Victor considers I hadn t considered an apprentice system before Mass training is how I received my own abilities If we download basic in to their heads with the speed up method then we could help them personally If we re just doing one or two Jean Luc says as he walks over The conversation could have been private you know Victor chides him Was it Jean Luc challenges No but honestly man Sure Anyways I heard something about training the locals more I m surprised you haven t pushed that harder There is a great deal of damage to reverse after the pirate gangs cleared the boats away The towns need time to find their bearing again Victor says And in the meantime we ve already been attacked more than once The sooner you have someone here that you can trust to at least slow down if not outright stop an enemy attack the better Yes but if there s nothing here to protect because the infrastructure and livelihoods of the people have been neglected then it s just empty land of little value Victor says frankly Well how much time do you have yet We ve been on here for just about a year now How much do you want to bet that we re due for another idiot any day now Jean Luc asks And what do you suggest then Grab everyone who looks like they can hold something vaguely threatening and download the Undaunted Training into their minds before running them ragged until they could conceivably conquer a planet on their own Well I was thinking more about looking into what our good Duchess has been doing with Moira Octarilly Knights I see Victor notes Well I ll need to get a training arena finished first Three in fact Aerial Combat Grounded Combat and Aquatic Combat Or you could do what I m going to do soon Jean Luc says and Victor slowly turns to regard him fully Tournaments Public entertainment too Bread and circuses are easy when you ve funded a dozen bakeries and are setting up the tents for the show Is this a strange way for you to challenge my territory Victor asks What No No yes Victor just gives Jean Luc the stink eye I m not just challenging you But we do need this world to have a bit more of a martial culture Tournaments to celebrate strength and unity Jean Luc says Take it from a Frenchman it doesn t matter how many wars you win you just need to lose once or twice to get a reputation for it And take it from a Russian forcing people into jobs they don t want does not work for anyone Victor returns Hmm Jean Luc remarks before looking out over the water Shellgather is built on Just consider it Not only will you be part of this But so will everyone else You ve spoken to the others You re the last Even Franklin You were underwater for about an hour I was talking to everyone then but you were in potentially hostile territory Potentially hostile to your virginity Jean Luc jokes and Victor raises an incredibly unimpressed eyebrow Right anyways What do you think I think that if you want to have a travelling tournament that s fine You re being very circumspect about this Not everyone was too happy with the idea that I wanted to have a tournament Jean Luc admits Why Duchess Lilpaw wants to have knighthoods and things like that as a reward for recruitment as she s done with Moira Franklin is thinking about opening up Axiom collages to train people to use it the same way he does Marcus wants more organized legions and basically it keeps going Everyone has their own ideas Jake s scares me the most in that he simply wants to up arm everyone to the point that trying to take any city or town will be met with a wall of laser fire and plasma Well if you try to phrase it differently it could work out the same way for you without stepping on too many toes Victor notes even as he sees a few smaller children of the community deciding that they wanted to steal the shell left over from the Deep Scuttler and were running off with part of a leg segment over their heads and their mother chasing after Anyways this is a conversation for more formal consideration Not just you trying to ambush me with the idea Right well I m just floating it for now We have our fleets we have our crews we have the Barons protecting areas And defensive satellites we re looking into massive shields and we are training a legitmate army I just want some kind of stopgap Local wardens or officers Jean Luc says I understand but it s still something that needs more consideration It s not a bad idea but it needs a bit more meat on it than just a basic description What level of training and I just said this was for more formal settings I m done discussing this for now Please Victor says and Jean Luc sighs Fine Fine my little mining towns will figure something more out Jean Luc says as he considers Are you sure that these Deep Scuttlers won t be up for trade They re tasty enough to make a good lobster substitute They re entirely for the Mirage Whales Unless you want to negotiate with them you re not getting anything other than the very rare catch Well do keep me on the shortlist for people to sell them to I love lobster so I ll pay very well for Deep Scuttler Jean Luc says Still if there s nothing more for me to be gained for And no jumping for joy at my tournament idea I ll just be heading home then It was wonderful to meet you all and best of luck with this place Victor I m sure you ll have all kinds of fun with it It s not about fun It s about duty I m sure it is Jean Luc says Just try to have some fun before you crack okay With that Jean Luc finds his way back to his own transportation handing out the rest of his little pamphlets and advertisements as he does so and blasts away Excuse me A young voice around Victor s thigh asks and he looks down to see a young boy one with very watery eyes and a clear amount of fear on his little Merra face Yes young man Victor asks kneeling down to be closer and less intimidating Uh someone said you want to train up men to be warriors does that mean me You re too young Maybe for the cadet program we ve got But not for actually fighting in battle What s a cadet Someone who gets the easier training and jobs Think of it like proper practice for training and being a military man Is it hard For some people it s very hard Being military isn t for everyone But for those that fit in with the military It s great It was great for me when I was younger Before I could even legally drive a vehicle I could shoot many kinds of gun set up a camp and knew how to call in coordinates for an attack or artillery strike Victor says with a smile In some ways I ve been military since I was as big as you You were as small as me once Everyone starts off small and weak Even Undaunted Even Primals You need to work at being strong to actually be strong Victor assures the young man Now if you want to join a cadet program That can be done It DOES however work at a central location so for part of the day you ll be far away from here but you ll be with other children who want to grow and be strong enough to fight for Vucsa I want that Do you Well a moment please Victor says as he starts patting as his pockets He finds it in his inside vest pocket Here we are Bring this to your family Your mother Head Mother or Father Tell them you want to be a cadet What is it The boy asks taking it It s the answers to several questions that come up a lot and ways for them to learn more We re not recruiting any cadets without parental permission Oh The boy says What s wrong Victor asks I I m adopted The boat thieves Oh I see Victor says as he thinks And your adoptive family Are they treating you well They are it s just I miss them The child says and Victor nods And you always will But that s something that becomes easier to deal with You re getting a little stronger to hold that up That s what it means to be alive Victor assures him Okay The little Merra boy says How about I walk you home then Victor offers Okay The boy says and Victor stands up straight as he gives Beatrice a questioning look She nods Which way little man Victor asks and the Merra boy points down the town His name is Drake Beatrice whispers to Victor as he starts to follow her His family was made an example of The whole community took him in after that It became the Kelpknot family officially after the Night of Blood Got it Victor confirms Thank you My pleasure Beatrice says as she follows along Clearly interested in how he intends to deal with the family AN Brain not found Yea

        "cleaned_text": "Prologue The Speech I could never forget the day my clutchmother told me about the Humans The lizard pauses her quills shimmering in the red sunlight as she sweeps her sharp hopeful gaze across the crowd of scholars of peers teachers everyone she s admired for the past twenty five cycles those strange wonderous messengers from the stars who descended on wings of fire surrounded by halos of blue light Humans Once thought to be mere myth proven now to have existed The more they learn of their predecessors the stranger it all becomes They came to our world so far back in history we consider it prehistoric and yet they seem to have vanished without a trace our first knowledge of them came from a painting A cave painting made by one of the many short lived evolutionary lines on our world We call them the Voral Mazarium an early sapient insectoid species cut off far too short due to high predatory rates from displaced carnivores when the humans arrived Much of this is known by now the humans the Mazarium how they are both parts of our history yet how much we know of one vastly outpaces the other Hatchlings are being taught what little is known in school these days the lizard speaker sees some youth there with their clutch mothers staring up at her in amazement excitement She sees the look in her eyes as the same look her professor gained from her when they met a smile creeps across her face as she too becomes excited by the situation Little is known why they came nor is it known why they left My family has been working on what we refer to as the SABEL drive a state of the art transport system that allows one to move from one point in space to another without needing to do all of that pesky travelling in the middle It shows great promise collapsing space in on itself using a singularity core so that we may travel the in between the more power we put in the further we travel but the less accurate it becomes so far we ve managed to collapse space by about percent allowing us to travel effectively at fifteen times the speed of light In theory at least the tests have all been small scale and today She glances towards her colleagues across the room those she has called her family the Kalith that stood by her and clears her throat quills trembling with trepidation I N keem N toth of the United Kalith of Vorn Aerospace division daughter of B taal N toth scientist of the United Kalith of Vorn Interkalith science academy have the honour of testing our first ever official SABEL drive craft I will be taking one mighty gust for the future of the Vorn Our first step in finding out why these humans came here why they left and who exactly they were the grand precursors explorers conquerors we will find the truth Every single person in the auditorium stands and cheers this has been in the public eye for a decade now the work they ve been putting in towards mastering interstellar travel All of it has been for progress for the unending question the mystery of humanity their purpose their presence How they got here why they came here how and why they disappeared so completely yet left just enough proof to show they were here all of it has been boggling our kind for a century now Some still worship them others doubt they were real calling it all the world s biggest hoax She can t help but sympathize a little scale less hairless bipedals with flaming wings and blue halos sounds exactly like something out of a religious text but too much evidence suggests they really existed The technology they must have had is staggering Ruins that cannot be strange metals and glassworks that do not match any compounds we know that have lasted longer than any structure possibly should fossilized remains lined neatly in the stone too perfect to be coincidence Cave paintings showing their arrival and general appearance albeit with the artistic talent of a Wrak slug Sounds with no source words with no soun My Kalith my family has been trying to get to the stars for generations We pioneered the colonization of our moons hell we re even trying to terraform one of our sister worlds these humans many called it an unhealthy obsession but every single one of us no matter how isolationist cannot help but be drawn to the story of humans and nobody is actually sure why We must get to the bottom of this It s our blood Our history We must find out what happened to the humans Next Chapter https www reddit com r HFY comments jxk what on earth happened to the humans ch Authors Note Greetings HFY ers I ve been watching this thread for some time now witnessing some wonderful stories and a bout of ideas got me writing a little short story of my own This will be my first post here hell my first post on Reddit overall so please excuse any mistakes I may make and feel free to give me a little advice here and there any typos I make will be corrected if I see them and I m more than open to seeing theories people come up with I wish to turn this into a proper multi part story but don t quite have any clue where to go as of yet Thanks for stopping by I hope you all enjoyed"
