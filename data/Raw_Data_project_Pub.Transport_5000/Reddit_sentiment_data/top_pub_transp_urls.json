But even for a country at its income level (real per capita GDP of $15k), it\u0019s still not good enough. And fixing it will be crucial if Vietnam is to have sustainable long run economic success and capitalise on current investment inflows. \n\nIntra-city Public transport: this is the biggest sticker for me. There is no semblance of public transport in Vietnamese cities. HCMC/Saigon, with a metro area of 17-18M people, has no metro system. That is absolutely insane. For comparison, [this](https://moovitapp.com/index/public-transit-maps/?map=Thailand_Bangkok_Bangkok_Rail_Transit_Network.pdf) is Bangkok\u0019s, with a metro area of 15M. [This](https://moovitapp.com/index/public-transit-maps/?map=Brazil_Sao_Paulo_e_Regio_Metropolitan_Transport_Map.pdf) is São Paulo\u0019s, with a metro area of about 23M. Both are rapidly expanding too, as you can see [here](https://youtu.be/i3sFfqq3N4Q?feature=shared ) and [here](https://youtu.be/_yuRKkbeo5g?feature=shared). Notice that even when these cities were significantly poorer in the 80s and 90s they still had a semblance of a transit system - HCMC yet has nothing. Hanoi isn\u0019t much better, Metro area population of 9M yet only one line. [This](https://myrapid.com.my/bus-train/rapid-kl/rapid-kl-integrated-transit-map/) is that of Kuala Lumpur, a metro area of similar population. Now of course these cities are significantly richer than Hanoi or HCMC but they started building out these systems when they were poorer. Building huge mass transit systems takes time and it needs to be started urgently in Vietnamese cities. Intracity Bus services in Vietnam are also totally unreliable or non existent in many cases.  \n\nThe issue of intracity transport is a ticking time bomb in Vietnam. Because as people get richer and move from bikes to cars the cities will become more gridlocked. Walking around Hanoi, Da Nang or Saigon, you can\u0019t help but ask yourself: if all these people on bikes were in cars, it would be physically impossible to get anywhere. The city would literally choke and shut down. The lack of public transit also makes roads more dangerous as bad riders and drivers are forced to use motor vehicles for lack of other options. \n\nInter-city public transport: Rail: The intercity rail in Vietnam is so ancient and inadequate it\u0019s comedic at this point. The trains are decades old and the technology is literally Victorian. Vietnam is the perfect place for high speed rail, I\u0019m shocked a country long high speed rail corridor from Hanoi to HCMC hasn\u0019t begun construction yet. But things like regional and commuter rail are also important. I was on a train in the north of Vietnam and I think our average speed across the journey was about 20-30 kmph. That is disastrous. It means the only way to actually travel between larger cities is by air, which is hugely inefficient/slow door to door as airports take hours to traverse, and often involves a connection in Hanoi or HCMC. For smaller cities near each other where the train is the only option there is really are no good transportation options. \n\nRoad: sure, but what about buses? Vietnamese intercity buses have improved a lot over the years but the fact is the state of road infrastructure is still poor. There just aren\u0019t enough highways. For such a dense country I would expect at least one highly modern, fast, wide highway between Hanoi and Can Tho passing outside all the major cities but there just isn\u0019t a pan-Vietnamese high speed road. And the road infrastructure within cities is totally inadequate, it often taking upwards of an hour to get out of the city centre. The poor roads are not only slow but they\u0019re dangerous and make logistics expensive. \n\nAgain, I know Vietnam is still developing, but what concerns me is that these projects are barely even under construction, let alone real progress being made with them. Transport infrastructure is one of the most important areas to invest for long run economic growth. I know the reasons it\u0019s not happening: phenomenally high levels of political corruption, messed up political incentives and wrong priorities. But I was surprised that during my time in Vietnam people didn\u0019t seem to notice that the transport infrastructure is woefully inadequate and is going to create an increasing suffocation on growth as time goes on. Something desperately needs to be done about it as the issue is only going to become more problematic as time goes on.\n\nVietnam is incredibly lucky with its human geography. The cities are effectively all in a curved line along the coast, meaning only a few modern, high quality transit and road corridors could connect up the vast majority of the population. The larger cities are also built on relatively flat deltas and plains. This makes construction easier - and Vietnam needs to capitalise on this and invest in its transport if it is to succeed.\n\nEdit: I can\u0019t believe I forgot to mention this but air pollution is the other huge issue caused by lack of public transport and slow traffic. Vietnamese cities are very air polluted and this can cause respiratory diseases, cancer and death for many people, especially the already vulnerable.","subreddit":"VietNam","comments":138,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/16tgpfu/vietnams_transport_infrastructure_is_totally/","_row":"Vietnam\u0019s transport infrastructure is totally inadequate: it\u0019s a ticking time-bomb"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-03","timestamp":1696354149,"title":"At what point does the public transport here become unacceptable?","text":"The Netherlands has the second most expensive public transport in the world, how can it be acceptable for it to be this sh*t?","subreddit":"Netherlands","comments":426,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/16yy0ia/at_what_point_does_the_public_transport_here/","_row":"At what point does the public transport here become unacceptable?"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-15","timestamp":1697378240,"title":"I hate america and the car culture","text":"I want to move to the Netherlands, NotJustBikes has convinced me america is a big car infested shithole that's not worth saving.\n\nEveryone here just drives big trucks, hates public transport, cyclist and the trans genocide the trump anti vaccine idiots support.\n\nI just really want to move to Amsterdam at least there everyone rides bikes.","subreddit":"AmerExit","comments":105,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmerExit/comments/178fwyz/i_hate_america_and_the_car_culture/","_row":"I hate america and the car culture"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-12","timestamp":1697113005,"title":"Kanye rents car and hotel in Reggio Emilia","text":"Soruce: https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/cultura/musica/2023/10/12/kanye-west-affitta-auto-e-hotel-a-reggio-emilia_35dbc32d-bfcd-4fc7-be69-2214b0a394fb.html\n\nNote: Ansa is the most reliable news source in Italy. \n\nTranslation: \n\nOnly the official announcement and, above all, a confirmed date are missing for Kanye West's concert at the Rcf Arena in Reggio Emilia, but the city seems to be all set.\n\nAccording to the local edition of Resto del Carlino, the American rapper has reportedly already rented cars with tinted windows for transportation in the city, and hotels have been pre-alerted for overnight stays for his 'crew,' including musicians, entourage, and technicians.\n\nThe stage for the big event at the Reggio Emilia Campovolo is almost set up after days of relentless work.

There have also been protests from feminist associations in Reggio, such as Nondasola and NonUnadiMeno, expressing their opposition in the local press, particularly in relation to Rammstein, the German metal band who will perform at the Rcf Arena on July 21, 2024, for the only Italian stop of their European tour, considering the sexual assault accusations against the band's frontman Till Lindemann.","subreddit":"GoodAssSub","comments":33,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodAssSub/comments/1765kt4/kanye_rents_car_and_hotel_in_reggio_emilia/","_row":"Kanye rents car and hotel in Reggio Emilia"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-25","timestamp":1695659115,"title":"Found on a post about improving public transportation infrastructure","text":"","subreddit":"insanepeoplefacebook","comments":23,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/insanepeoplefacebook/comments/16rwo1f/found_on_a_post_about_improving_public/","_row":"Found on a post about improving public transportation infrastructure"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-05","timestamp":1696500195,"title":"Women only trains and buses?","text":"Does anyone else find this insulting?

Read this.","text":"I'm a current employee at SAE, not for much longer. I am writing this whole thing because SAE is a popular choice for low-time pilots and I wish I had a lot of this knowledge before I applied. I have **a lot** of things I'd like to share, if you're considering working here. I can only speak toward the Caravan side of the operation. A lot of these thoughts have been bottled up for the better part of a year and a half, so bear with me. I've also been somewhat interviewing other pilots to get their thoughts as well, which will be included. TLDR below each major category, and at the very end.\n\nSo here we go, starting with a pros/cons list.\n\nPros: very valuable time-building, professional experience in different airports/weather conditions in a low-risk aircraft, will look good on a resume and easy to do well with interviews as far as explaining your systems/operations in an interview down the road.\n\nCons: the company lies to you, tries to get you to sign/do things you maybe shouldn't, very low FO pay, is run by dirtbags (for the most part), the list could go on really but those are the main things.\n\nOverview: SAE is a 135 operation funded by **E**ssential **A**ir **S**ervice (EAS) routes ran by the government. We do short hops from small towns connecting them to large airports. It's a popular job for low-time pilots, the company says they hire at 500 hours total time minimum but this isn't entirely true as I know many pilots who got hired at 250. The strategy here is to get in, get your time and get out without anyone knowing you were even there - I cannot emphasize this enough. If the people upstairs know your name as a pilot on the line, that's a bad thing, and I'm told this is generally true of any airline.\n\n*Logging time*\n\nWasn't sure where else to put this really. There's this thing called the Pilot Development Program, where you have to get each flight signed by a qualified PIC for it to count towards your time. Our Ops Spec was changed some time ago, we used to allow flights to operate without an SIC as long as a functional autopilot was installed. During this era, we had the PDP. This was changed, and FOs are now required crew. As far as logging time goes, I'm someone that uses an electronic logbook, and I put their signature in myself along with their contact information and a note saying that we followed the regs of the PDP - this was good enough. Traditionally companies using PDP have to have the SIC logbook signed by a qualified PIC for each flight. The thing is that while the Caravan is techinically a single-pilot aircraft, our company is required to have a PIC and SIC. Therefore the specifics of getting your PIC to sign your logbook every time don't apply at SAE. Since we *have* to have both, the PDP doesn't apply. At the very least I put their name in my logbook, and it has contact information. The company will tell you that we technically use the PDP, but again since our company is required to have PIC and SIC aboard, the PIC signatures are not required every time as outlined by the fed.\n\n**The Good**\n\n*Time value*\n\nI'd like to start with the positives, since at the end of the day I do believe this is a company worth working for. First and foremost, the time is definitely worth it. Turbine time is no joke, especially in the event that jet companies get choosy between you and the guy with 2000 hours of piston time. After captain, you're looking at PIC turbine time - also very valuable, not just for the time aspect, but showing experience as PIC in a 135 airline. The next job knows you take 9 passengers at most. They know you're doing short hops, they know all about how the company is run, what you fly, etc.. but it's about more than that. There is a lot of experience to be gained working here. Some of the big jet guys might scoff, but this job allows you to get in the habit of making professional, good choices on the ground and in the air in a plane that can't really get away from you if you get too stressed. The Caravan babies you, really. It can be a great entry into the industry because the mistakes you will make (hopefully) won't be mistakes that could cost your license, or lives.\n\n*SkyWest*\n\nThere is an opportunity to get a guaranteed interview with SkyWest. They do their little presentation at indoc, pass out some pens, and ask you to sign a contract. It states that you will commit to flying with SAE as an FO, upgrade to captain, and fly 600 hours as PIC before you leave the company for SkyWest. Your choices are to either do this, or not go to SkyWest and agree to do 1200 hours PIC with SAE. Contract also comes with $17500 split up in to three stages: released to the line at SAE, captain at SAE, and completion of SkyWest ground school. I wanted to go to SkyWest next, so this was a no-brainer for me. If you leave early, or choose to not go to SkyWest, they will ask for their money back but you can set up a payment plan with them.\n\nSkyWest owns a portion of SAE, and has a vested interest in hiring from SAE. I know a lot of people saying that it would be stupid to sign the contract, that SkyWest would just take their money back and not hire you - this is idiotic, and would defeat the purpose of spending all that money in the first place. Airlines make so much money partially *because* they have pilots. News flash, you need pilots to have an airline. Here's another news flash, SkyWest needs more pilots, everyone needs more pilots. $17k laughable for SkyWest because they'll make so much more of that back if they hire you. Basic economics.\n\n*Good times*\n\nI have had really tough times here, and really great times here. The flying can be a lot of fun. There's a lot of opportunity to refine your skills in a plane that will truly babysit you. There are some really good people that work for this company. Hard working ground crew, *some* people in upper management that truly want you to be safe and succeed. These things go a long way, for me at least.\n\nTLDR: SAE offers some serious value in time with logging turbine hours and 135 airline experience, PIC turbine can go a long way. Future employment opportunities offered by SkyWest with $17.5k bonus. There's a lot of good times to be had here in general, with good people and some awesome views from the Caravan. It's hard work, but it's engaging and challenging in its own way.\n\n**The Bad**\n\n*Indoc*\n\nNow the bad, and there's plenty of it. When you interview, you're going to be told you can easily expect 90 hours a month - this is a lie. Really no one can tell you how many hours you will get per month. You might get 70 one month, 100 another month. I knew FOs scheduled for 80 hours but had so many flights cancelled that they ended up only logging 25 hours.\n\nAt indoc, you will be told to sign a promissory note (fancy word for a contract) that says if you leave early/get fired, you will be sued. You will be told to sign on the spot or walk out the door. It's a simple one-page contract, I read it thoroughly and signed. I desperately needed the job, as many of my colleagues did. SAE has been suing former pilots, and I for one can understand why many of them left, more on that in a bit. I understood what I signed. Many of my colleagues did not, and they signed because there was some rumor that SAE isn't suing anyone. Now they're running around upset because their going to court since they broke the contract. This was their foolish mistake. I'd rather sign a bad contract on purpose than based on wishful thinking. As valid as some of their complaints may be, don't be like them.\n\nAt indoc, you'll meet the heads of several departments. The Director of HR will talk to you about how you're a child and irresponsible, and give you the usual HR seminar while using basically any opportunity she can to belittle you so just don't ask questions. The Director of Maintenance will literally yell at you and tell you that you don't know anything about flying. He'll use his hour to expand on how much of an idiot you are, despite knowing nothing about you, and despite not having flown himself in decades if at all. I think if it were up to him, the mechanics would be the only pilots. The CEO will come in and give his speech about how awesome he is and how SAE is the greatest small airline to exist despite secretly-not-so-secretly being a downright scumbag who likes to fire pilots who refuse to fly in unsafe conditions. The Director of Ops will come in and speak as well, from my experience he's actually a really nice guy, but I try to interact with these people as little as possible overall.\n\n*Equipment*\n\nAt indoc, you may also be told that the majority of the fleet is comprised of G1000 EX Caravans. This is also a lie. Most of our aircraft are from the 90's-early 2000's. Most of the FO instruments do not work. Maintenance tries their best, but they're encouraged by the Director of Maintenance to cut corners and all the good mechanics - the ones who really care and are really knowledgeable - leave as soon as they can. The company is supposed to have autopilots, it's listed as required equipment, but pilots write it up because they're from 1990 and don't work. So, the SAE solution is to just remove the autopilot altogether and claim it's temporarily \"deactivated\" when we all know it's permanent.\n\n*Hours &amp; Pay*\n\nMany in my class were told we would get a certain amount of hours a month, some of us went as far to get a letter from our boss confirming that, showed that to our landlords/creditors/etc.and got the apartment/car/etc. - only to have the hours slashed in half or even to a quarter out of nowhere. As an FO, it is a struggle to live. That's just the truth. You are told you're a \"required crewmember\" the CEO will brag about all the efforts he went through to get the FAA to see it that way, but no one will care about your ideas, or how you're going to afford your next meal. As a captain, life is easy. You get bonus pay on top of bonus pay, they beg you to fly and you can ask for an extra $500 on your day off flying and they'll happily say yes. For FO's on their day off, your pay is $30, and if you beg they'll come up from that to a whopping $35. Never mind that the plane doesn't leave without you on-board anyway, but they're counting on someone else showing up if you don't want to, and someone will. Some captains have asked why this is the case to trusted people in upper management, and they say they're fighting for better FO pay, but there's a lot of pushback from everyone else (I'm guessing from the Director of Maintenance, HR, CEO, President of Something, etc. just based on their attitude towards pilots). Basically, your average captain will easily make four times as much as your average FO.\n\nThe pay structure goes like this: under 600 hours, $12/hour in training, $15 when released to the line. At 600 hours, $18/hour. At 900 hours, $21/hour. captain is $43/hour, direct entry is something like $55/hour, with bonuses if you sign a longer contract. If a captain hits 85 hours in a month, all hours after that are paid at time and a half. If a captain flies 115 hours in a month, they'll get a bonus check of $2000. When I was an FO some months I got 100 hours, other months I hovered around 60-70 hours for a while. As a captain I'm almost guaranteed to get 105+ hours, even if I'm scheduled for less there is so much bonus flying available and they'll pay so much extra that it doesn't matter. All pilots are guaranteed 65 hours a month in pay.\n\n*Bases*\n\nYou also may be told in indoc that you will have your first choice of base. I've asked many folks in the class before me and classes after, they all said this is still being said. It's not true. They don't care about your choice of where you want to go, they will throw your name in one bowl, and the list of bases in another bowl and pick at random. You can transfer, but it's not guaranteed. If you're commuting, tough. If you're moving in base, tough. Got a family, not their problem. Can't afford to move/commute for reasons, not their problem.\n\n*Chief Pilot*\n\nI haven't had much experience with our Chief Pilot, but your interaction with him and anyone else in upper management should be as minimal as possible. With the CP it depends on which side of the bed he woke up on that day. Might be in a great mood, might rip your head off. As a captain I've personally had no issues when it came to me not wanting to fly due to safety concerns, but I have friends who had the exact opposite experience. Since the investigation by the FAA became more widely known (mentioned below), I think this portion of the toxic culture has shifted a bit towards the better, but it's still not where it should be.\n\nTLDR: if you're told something is guranteed, they're lying to you. There's an overall negative and quite unhelpful culture at SAE. Aircraft are very old and maintained only well enough to be mostly airworthy. FO pay is absolutely abysmal, but if you're financially responsible you will stay afloat, probably. Captain pay is massively better.\n\n**The Ugly**\n\n*The Fed*\n\nThis company is currently under some form of investigation by the FAA. For what specifically, I don't know. But it most definitely has to do with unsafe practices, such as upper management pressuring pilots to fly in unsafe conditions, though that seems to have gotten better recently. We know for a fact that the FAA has dropped the hammer on SAE and some employees at Southern have been forced out as a result. There's no communication in this company, which leads to much frustration between the pilots and ground crew. I've been scheduled to fly when I'm not legally able to, been activated on reserve with no notice, I had a friend who was scheduled to fly in a different state on his day off with zero notice or transportation just to wake up to an angry phone call from management.\n\n*The Money*\n\nThe Company went public on the NYSE a few months ago, and the stock price tanked immediately. It's been hovering a little above a dollar per share. I'm not a stonks guy, but this is a decent indication of where the company is at financially. The company's business model is based on EAS routes provided by the fed, SAE receives hundreds of thousands of dollars per week flying in to places like ATL, LAX, ORD, DFW - all that money seems to go.. absolutely everywhere else except where it is most needed, and it's needed to be spent on the people and the aircraft for once. The company has also expanded way too much, and despite the CEO saying he's done expanding, there's rumors we're going to expand anyway. He's warned by his management team that it's not a wise decision, and does it anyway. The problem is we don't have the staff or aircraft for the bases we have now, leading to angry city council meetings and threats of revoking the contract with SAE. A while ago a new top-tier scheduling system was proposed, because ours is garbage - too much money. Upgrading aircraft so we don't have failing instruments every week, too much money. Paying the pilots and ground crew a respectable wage, too much money. Rotating the aircraft to Maintenance bases so that they get the attention they need, too much money. Salary increases for the top people? Fantastic idea. Placing an order for a bunch of electric Caravans that no one knows if they actually work? Fantastic idea.\n\nThese frustrations are just some of the reasons why pilots leave early, and end up getting sued by the company like I mentioned earlier. If you leave early as an FO, you'll be sued for something like $20k. If you leave early as a captain, you'll be sued for around $10k. The claim is that these are proportional to the cost it was to train you, which I doubt.\n\n*The Training*\n\nThe training that SAE provides is kind of a joke. Ground school is in-depth. Sim training and flight training is rushed. You're so close to being on the line that they definitely cut corners to get you released to the line, and it shows in the quality of flying I've personally seen from many of our pilots. I sometimes wonder how some of these people got their license to begin with. I've had captains that couldn't track a localizer or a glideslope, had an FO that couldn't hold a heading or altitude to save his life, the list could go on. While you can't, or rather shouldn't have to teach these things to pilots, you can at least take more time to really show you care and work with them - this culture does not exist in the training department. Some of the instructors are very impatient. As an FO I went into training being told over and over again that it was four days of flight training. My instructor wanted to give me my checkride on day two, and not because I showed skill - I was obviously not ready, but he had lots more waiting in line for training and needed to get me out of the way. These kinds of practices lead to unsafe practices on the line. Captain upgrade training is joining a zoom call, instructor puts on a video for you to watch and leaves. You'll have some opportunity to ask questions, to which the Chief Pilot will just get mad at you for not looking it up yourself. Then you're sent to your checkride and IOE. I feel like I have to say it again: this is your c*aptain upgrade training.*\n\nThe company may send you to Flight Safety for your training after indoc. This is a far superior kind of training than what SAE offers. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to who gets to go. Interestingly, in the contract with SAE I mentioned earlier you owe about $20k to the company if you leave/get fired. It costs around $18k to send someone to Flight Safety, but doesn't cost nearly as much to send them to the SAE training in Hawaii or DuBois.\n\n*The Captains*\n\nSpeaking of which, let's talk about the captains of SAE. They're awful, except for me of course, I'm amazing (as I'm sure everyone I've ever met would agree). In all seriousness, there are so many different standards at this company. When I was an FO this was extremely frustrating. It was like every other captain I flew with had it right and everyone else has it all wrong, they know the airplane like the back of their hand, they know better procedures than outlined in the manual, they know more than the Check Airmen, the list goes on. I was given so many different preflight briefings as an FO, it was hard to keep the facts straight. Everyone had a different idea of what they would do in an emergency, at what altitude they would turn back for the runway if need-be. It was like the basic information was just not agreed upon by the common captain. It was a major relief to upgrade for this reason alone, because I knew I would work with my FO, and that we would only rely on the facts in the cockpit and not some completely made-up procedure. *However*, I also had some real cream-of-the-crop captains who taught me so much about how to be a better pilot. Were it not for them, I would seriously be lost and in a world of trouble. There are some captains at this company that really empathize with your struggles as an FO, and will guide you on the best practices of the aircraft and how to handle working for a company like this. I'll be forever grateful for these people, and absolutely none of them were direct entry captains.\n\nThe direct entry captains are awful, every single one of them. As an FO I probably flew with 9 or 10 direct entry captains, and they were some of the worst pilots I've ever flown with by far. The fact that they entered in as a captain I think made it so much worse. Had these kinds of captains talking to me like I was one of their students, meanwhile I had four times the amount of hours that they did in the aircraft. Never met one direct entry captain that was truly willing to work *with* their FO, and it seriously hurt the operation. There's not a single direct entry captain I would trust in any emergency situation.\n\nTLDR; FAA is investigating SAE, company may be on the verge of financial collapse but I don't think that's likely to happen anytime soon because of how much money we make from the fed but they spend money on all the wrong things, the ground training is good but the sim/flight training can be very bad and very rushed depending on who you get. The captains can be downright awful, or some of the best people you'll ever fly with, it's a roll of the dice.\n\n*The Maintenance*\n\nI wanted to expand on this point. I've mentioned a few times that the airplanes are in awful condition. I once met a mechanic at a base once, hired outside of SAE to do some work on our plane. We did a walk-around and he proceeded to point out all the ways in which the plane was not even airworthy. This mechanic had worked on Caravans for a decade, and had never seen so many issues. It was obvious to him that some of the SAE mechanics had been cutting corners or flat out releasing airplanes ot the line that were not airworthy.\n\nThis goes to a larger point I would like to make about the Director of Maintenance. He is someone you never want to interact with. Some mechanics at SAE, like many people, are just trying to do a good job. When you have a boss like that who controls your life, who you depend on for reliable information, it can be tough to make the right call. That being said, I have only met one mechanic who has a true vested interest in doing his best, and only releasing safe airplanes to the line. We had a phenominal mechanic who came from a company that SAE absorbed, and he left shortly after. He saw the signs and moved on. Others don't have that ability right now.\n\nI can confirm that mechanics at Southern are passively (or actively) encouraged to cut corners. This was a truly scary thing to discover, because flying an airplane that is not airworthy, to be discovered by the Fed, is a bad place to be in as a pilot. Or worse - perishing because of it.\n\n**The Bottom Line**\n\n*Perspective*\n\nFlying for SAE will be entirely what you make of it. Are you going to be just a spiteful individual, embarrassed to fly the Caravan, frustrated with the company all day long, hating passengers, hating handflying, hating the pay, just hating everything? Or are you going to go a different route? As you can tell I've got a lot of feelings about the company, many of us do, but I honestly wouldn't go back. I was in absolute poverty when I got offered this job, it was a feeling of relief that I kept reminding myself of to keep pushing forward - even if the company still kept me in poverty as an FO, I had a job, I had a foot in the door. Now the door has fully opened, I'm out of the company pretty soon. I've wanted to say something about my experience for a while, but I wanted to make sure I experienced everything; the good, the bad, and the ugly before I really formed an opinion I felt was worth sharing.\n\nI've seen quite a few pilots on reddit trash SAE, read one comment mocking the \"it's valuable time\" message that I'm basically saying here - well it is, and I believe that's a fact. Earlier I mentioned it being between you and a guy with 2000 hours of piston, this was one of my good friends who came from SAE: they flat out told him the turbine time was the deciding factor there and hired him practically on the spot.\n\nPeople will claim you'll make much more doing this or that, that's just not the case for myself and many others I know. How much you'll make being a CFI, for example, largely has to do with the economy and your area, how much you're willing to put yourself out there, how many students you have. If it works for you, that's awesome, but it wasn't going to work for me. I sent out 12 job applications when I got to 500 hours, badgered all of them, SAE was the only one who got back to me. The job market may have changed, but back when I applied your choices were basically CFI, pipeline inspection or SAE.\n\nI've had 737/777/A320/A330 pilots and so-on tell me about how they think it's really cool to fly a Caravan, it's a different kind of flying than what they get to do, they miss how involved flying used to be, and so on. I don't say that to sound like they envy pilots like me, although one did jokingly say that. I've read similar comments on youtube videos on bush flying and the like. I say this to make the point that there is value in all different kinds of flying, and there is trumendous value in flying the Caravan for SAE, it is just going to come with an equally hefty amount of BS. I did find that once I upgraded, a lot of that BS went away or I was respected enough to be able to deal with it properly, to make a proper living, to be safe.\n\nWhen you're a very low-time pilot looking for your first job, the pay can't be everything. What else are you gaining from this job? What about the experience? Professionalism? Perfection opportunities? Challenges? Questions worth asking yourself, both when you're looking towards a job and when you're looking back on one from the other side. There were days I woke up wondering why I'm putting myself through this. Waking up two hours early to get ready and make my lunch (eventually started skipping lunch because it was costing too much in groceries), getting to work an hour before departure, loading up annoying people, sometimes flying with someone I really didn't like or trust at all - then I put on my 80's music, watch the sunrise, and it all becomes clear, or at least clear enough to do it over and over again.\n\nI have had to make a lot of personal sacrifices to get where I am today, as many of us in the industry have. Many of us have had to say goodbye to long-time friends, goodbye to home, it's tough and definitely took a toll on me with the struggles of this job. The toughest part was believing I was finally out of poverty when I got that job offer. I had done it, I succeeded, and it was all uphill from here. That's wishful thinking, life is never like that. I still had to struggle, but if I knew half the things I've outlined here it would've been a lot easier to get through those tough times. I think if the company had just been honest with me, or if someone had put out information like this, I would have been much better prepared. That's what I hope I was able to do for someone else with this post.\n\nI know I can look back on my work with SAE as an overall positive, very rewarding experience; where I learned a lot, became a better pilot, became a better individual and took lessons learned from this stepping stone to be applied for the rest of my career. At the end of the day, I'm pretty happy with that.\n\nThank you for reading, I'm happy to answer any questions I can.\n\n**Very much needed TLDR:**\n\nSouthern has a lot of issues, primarily involving safety, qualilty of aircraft, quality of training.. there are a lot of things to consider if you're thinking about working for this company. I will walk away with some great experience, and also some awful times. I know plenty who are walking away with a lawsuit, notes on their PRIA, wasted time, nothing but bad times if you ask them. Some things in life are what you make of it. I think I was fortunate enough to have enough lemons to make lemonade at SAE, but there were many who couldn't get past the massive issues. I don't see anything improving unless there's a restructuring of leadership, mainly a new CEO to lead the company in a new direction.\n\nThere may be more options for low-time pilots now which will give turbine time if that's a goal for you, I don't know. If I could do it all over again, I might try harder for a FedEx feeder, but SAE got me where I needed to go. For me, this was my best option at the time and it worked out just fine. If I had no other options and wanted the turbine time, I would still go to Southern, but would try to enter at 600 hours for the $18/hour. It made a big difference.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\nEdits: Added a section about maintenance, expanded on the training, added a TLDR","subreddit":"flying","comments":103,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/17fvwip/want_to_work_for_southern_airways_express_read/","_row":"Want to work for Southern Airways Express?

I\u0019m from a small city in the Carolina\u0019s and rarely take public transportation (I\u0019m guessing like most of Tampa residents). Anyways, my girlfriend offered to take me to work but I figured what the heck I\u0019ll take the bus as I see them around all the time. Here\u0019s how it went! \n\nTo start I left from the downtown transit center near my apartment. It was clean there were quite a few homeless people around but none bothered me or anyone else getting on the bus.\n\nThe bus it\u0019s self was clean although it had a slight musty smell. The AC was PUMPING to the point it was cold. The bus had maybe 3 passengers when I got on. Everyone was doing their own thing headphones in heads down. A pleasant announcement tells you what stop is next. (Side note to pay there is a little scan thing at the front left or a cash box next to the driver I paid on the Moovit app, not sure how they verify). \n\nThe ride was quicker than I thought it would be, it\u0019s normally a 20 min ride. It took about 27 min. The bus doesn\u0019t stop at empty stops which speeds it up quite a bit. \n\nTo get off the bus anywhere you\u0019d like (I think) all you need to do is pull the cord next to your window. This is important if you don\u0019t they will breeze past your stop, I did this going to work, but pulled the cord at the next stop and it wasn\u0019t a big deal. \n\nOverall I would give my experience a 8/10 if I was drinking and needed a ride 10/10 easily better than a $25 uber on a Friday night. \n\nI will add I\u0019ve heard the buses can be quite delayed, I can\u0019t comment on their reliability but both of my buses were shockingly punctual. \n\nTL;DR\n\nTake the bus! It\u0019s clean enough and cheap and would be more than sufficient for a night of drinking.","subreddit":"tampa","comments":56,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/tampa/comments/17456sa/i_rode_the_hart_for_the_first_time/","_row":"I Rode the HART for the First Time"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-15","timestamp":1697367998,"title":"Planned a One Piece pilgrimage and it exceeded all expectations","text":"What started off as our trip to Japan for the One Piece Premier Show and Sanji's Restaurant at USJ and Kumamoto to visit all 10 statues and eat at the Baratei became the trip of a lifetime.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/reel/CyIZWF9R9Sv/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\n\nWe met countless of people who love One Piece and created core memories for each other. I have been able to become lifelong friends with some of them and have made promises to meet again one day.\n\nOne of my favourites was at Engyo-ji where this group of elementary school students hounded me for gifts after they found out I had given some of their friends my handmade One Piece keychains and I almost didn't have enough and had to dig into my reserves of Merlion keychains and pens.\n\nWe met a man whose mother had worked with Oda-sensei's mother before.\n\nWe learned why Oda-sensei went from writing \"ºY\" to \"\u0012Y\". (Kill to Defeat)\n\nWe learned about why the 4 Blues are the NSEW Blues and why Luffy is from East Blue specifically and why out of the 4 Yonkos there was only 1 female.\n\nWe met a couple whose factory was directly involved in the Kumamoto Revival Project's statues and we exchanged gifts.\n\nWe met a father and son, and bonding over our love for One Piece, gave us a lift from Luffy to Chopper and declared ourselves nakama.\n\nWe got to sit on the Thousand Sunny train which was a huge throwback to us being on the Thousand Sunny ship in 2016.\n\nWe dined at the Baratei, where Oda-sensei used to work part time at. (He actually worked at the sister restaurant of the same name which has closed its doors.)\n\nWe ate food cooked by the very same chef that used to yell at Oda-sensei when he dropped plates and was very likely, the inspiration behind Baratie's head chef Zeff.\n\nWe listened to Tasaki-san refer to Oda-sensei as Oda-kun and point out his interview and photo in the One Piece magazine issue 4 page 48 and 49.\n\nWe held the actual framed autographs by Oda-sensei and Yamaguchi Yuriko-sensei (Robin's voice actress).\n\nAnd I think Tasaki-san must have really liked us because the 2nd time we visited the restaurant, the frames were already waiting for us in our private room. And we received a copy each of Oda-sensei's autograph on a shikishi from him. (Along with a photograph of his car, and him telling us cars were his hobby =\u0002=)\n\nThis entire trip was one for the lifetimes and I do not think anything will top it again.\n\nSo here's some photographs from the trip and official souvenirs we got along the way!\n\nThere's an official pamphlet detailing the Kumamoto Revival Project in Japanese and English, I've uploaded the English one. It also comes with a map of Kumamoto pointing out where all 10 statues are.\n5 of them are reachable by public transport and good planning. The other 5 are in DjK (rural) locations that require the use of a car.\nWe met a pair of siblings from Texas who had paid for a service to bring them around to all 10 in a day. It's tough but doable, however you miss out on everything Kumamoto has to offer you.\n\nAt each location, you are able to purchase a status replica for ¥2200 and you receive a postcard of the character (all details in Japanese only). You can also receive the postcard without purchasing the figurine. However, it is one card/statue per person. You can purchase the figurines at these [locations](https://op-kumamoto.com/news/375/). Do take note of their opening hours.\n\nFor those interested, we spent a week in Kumamoto. This was our itinerary.\n\nDay 1 (JR Pass)\n- Statues: ZORO, LUFFY, CHOPPER\n- Mugiwara store\n- Dinner at Baratei\n\nDay 2 (JR Pass)\n- FRANKY statue and THOUSAND SUNNY\n- Also met a couple from Kagoshima and the man's mother had worked with Oda-sensei's mother. He also commented to his wife/gf \"You think you're a fan? Look at them!\" (Us. Haha)\n- Kagoshima (purchase a cute pass to get round here)\n\nDay 3 (last day of JR Pass)\n- Kagoshima to Sakurajima (rent a car to drive round the entire island!

This argument is flawed for several reasons and as someone who lives with people with limited mobility, (my mother and my grandma) the \"What about disabled people?\" argument is flawed.\n\nFor context, my mother had her knee surgery and for a few weeks, she couldn't walk too far as her knee was stiff and couldn't bend too far (This is normal, don't worry she's fine now). Needless to say, we had quite the experience and we were lucky enough that my aunt let us borrow her wheelchair (which we still have) as despite my mom's limited mobility temporary as it is, we were able to see places and experience stuff that we have never done before as we were privileged enough to be residing with my grandma who lives in one of the few places in North America that has good, accessible transit and overall better urban planning. The Lower Mainland of British Columbia, Canada.\n\nAs to not plagiarize what this fellow Reddit poster has coined as the [Car Savior Complex](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/171f2hw/ive_seen_this_a_lot_online_lately_this_notion/), I am going to go through some of the characteristics of their definition and how they correlate with my mother's real-life experience with limited mobility.\n\nGoing through their Characteristics list, point 2 states that:\n\n\"2. **Limited Accessibility Consideration:** Ignoring the accessibility barriers faced by individuals who may find it challenging to enter, exit, or operate traditional vehicles due to their disability.\"\n\nThis point was so true in the case of my mother's knee surgery because after she was discharged from the hospital, my father and I had so much difficulty trying to get her into our minivan (2019 Honda Odyssey). Despite minivans generally being better than most cars when it comes to accessibility, my mom couldn't bend her knee too far which is needed when it comes to entering a car. And sure, minivans can be modified to be accessible, but those conversions are expensive and are an admittance that standard cars are *not* accessible.\n\nWhat these car-brained people fail to acknowledge is that cars are not easy to climb into. I remember one time when visiting the US with my father, we were at a gas station and we saw this older man struggling to climb out of his oversized pickup truck. When he finally got out, he saw me sitting in the passenger seat of our minivan and said that and I'm transcribing what he said, \"If I knew I would have this (mobility issues) I wouldn't have driven this pickup truck.\"\n\nSo yeah, he admitted that his pickup truck is difficult to climb into. Maybe you shouldn't have bought it in the first place buddy. I still have trouble comprehending seeing giant pickup trucks with their handicap passes when I, an able-bodied person have trouble climbing into a stock modern F-150. Cars are not accessible, and pickup trucks are not!\n\nOkay, sorry for the rant. I'll cover one more point out of the Car Savior Complex.\n\n\"3. **Neglect of Public Transportation:** Dismissing the potential benefits of accessible public transportation, shared mobility services, or active transportation methods, which can offer viable options for many people with disabilities.\"\n\nWe are privileged enough to be staying with my grandma who lives in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, Canada which is one of the few places in North America which has good, accessible transit. Despite not having a driver's license and my grandma not driving much, with the wheelchair from my aunt, I and my mom were able to see many places by using the bus and SkyTrain. We went to the mall, the park, downtown, etc. all while my mom did not need to leave her wheelchair. My mom has a greater appreciation for the transit system in BC because if we didn't have our bus and SkyTrain system, we would be stuck at home.\n\nAlso, I see many people and seniors use the SkyTrain with some of them riding very large and bulky mobility scooters like the heavy-duty [Shoprider Enduro XL4](https://shoprider.com/products/scooters/enduro-xl4). I doubt that these giant mobility scooters can fit inside a car, but they fit inside the SkyTrain with minimal difficulties. I'll take oversized mobility scooters over oversized pickup trucks any day of the week.\n\nNeedless to say, for people with mobility requirements, contrary to what car-brained people who buy into the Car Savior Complex believe, accessible transit provides these people with freedom and independence that car-centric infrastructure can never provide. Keep in mind, I only covered the physical limitations of cars, never mind the cognitive requirements needed to drive a car and how many people cannot safely operate a car, even if they're physically able.\n\nAre there improvements that transit can make? Yes, of course. Apart from improving service and frequency, transit should be wheelchair accessible with ramps and elevators and level boarding for trains. Older transit systems need to be upgraded to be ADA (or your country's equivalent) compliant. I'm looking at you New York Subway!\n\nWith newer systems (1980's onward) they are built with accessibility in mind. During my mother's recovery process, we were able to go around with minimal difficulties. The only minor issues we had were with the Mark I, Mark II, and Mark III SkyTrain on the Expo and Millennium Line as they're narrower due to their smaller loading gauge, only 2.65 meters wide, and they use folding seats for the designated wheelchair areas. But we had no issue with the Canada Line trains as they have a larger loading gauge at 3 meters wide and have a wide, empty space for wheelchair users. If possible, newer metro systems should be designed with a larger loading gauge of 3 meters or more to allow for more room onboard.\n\nRegardless, while modern transit systems are designed to be accessible, cars are not due to them being physically hard to get into and requiring a lot of cognitive function to operate. \"What about these bidirectional, low-floor autonomous cars that look like pills?\" Sure, maybe in the future, but that isn't coming soon. And instead of having people travel far to get their basic needs, shops, and amenities should be close by where nobody has to walk far to get what they need.\n\nAnyway, I thought that I would share my story with you as while this topic has been covered before, ever since helping my mom, I've become an advocate for accessibility so that everybody can enjoy all parts of life while being independent.

It practically breeds depression. Your boss has complete ownership over your life. If your boss calls you in on a Saturday morning in order to be a \"good worker\" you would have to answer the call and rush to save the day. Our pathetic work culture doesn't consider the mental health, the personal life, and the needs of the worker. The company and the share holders will always be given priority. Your feeble personal life means nothing to management. It is always up to YOU the worker to prove yourself. The company owes you nothing from their point of view. You are replaceable and expendable and as soon as you lose usefulness they will drop you like a bad habit. \n\nIt is impossible in todays Hussle culture to maintain a personal/work life balance. Your sole existence from the time you are a child till the moment you die is to make yourself marketable to the economy.  If you are unable to do so you will be cast aside and laughed at by the greater society, even if your job is important you will be treated like utter dirt. Millions of workers in America are living paycheck to paycheck because apparently the mystical economy did not deem them worthy of a living wage. If you do not do exactly what the unquestionable economy tell you to do, you deserve whatever you get in life because of it. No need for basic things like healthcare, dental, transportation, housing, and food. These are all lavish expenditures that only those that win the economic lottery deserve to have. If you are lucky you will finally be able to afford a house after 50 years of saving every last penny and eating ramen noodles every day while not ever having fun. Maybe, just maybe you might be able to do it. If you don't, well sorry! It must be your fault someway somehow because our mystical magical thing called the economy is never ever ever wrong. So remember folks! Just hustle hustle hustle! Keep working for something you may or may never be able to get. Sell your soul to these companies and be a good little worker. Your life doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is the omnipotent economy. \n\nThis disgusting system is so blatantly immoral it is a wonder how we are still putting up with it. People are finally just now waking up from the spell. How the hell is the minimum wage still 7.25 an hour. Are we still under the illusion that the current level of inequality is due to laziness and not exploitation? The middle class is dead. And greed killed it. People did exactly what they were told and have only been slapped in the face. You have skilled professionals with college degree's unable to land a studio apartment. The minimum wage should realistically be 30 dollars an hour (probably more). This is a systematic crisis that has yet to be addressed by any of those from the top of the pyramid. It is because they directly benefit from this exploitation. The people who are suppose to protect us are getting billions from lobbying corporations. We truly have no choice but to strike. It is our only tool left. Lets see what happens when the wheels stop turning. Maybe then they will take us seriously. Lets shut down every store, every service, every company, every industry and the whole of this economy until every last worker is lifted from poverty. If the system doesn't work it needs to be fixed. No one should be living as a second class citizen unable to buy basic goods in the richest country in the world.\n\nOnly time will tell if this becomes a reality. We are making rounds in the public consciousness like never before. The working class needs to unite for a better future. Both Democrat and Republican. Black and White. Short and Tall. Blue collar and white collar. All need to unite so we can finally get our piece of the pie. Division is their greatest tool and it has done a hell of a number on us. Our greatest weapon is solidarity. These is class warfare. Time to bring back the middle class. Time to bring back the American dream.

Recently through someone I know I found an opportunity to move to NYC for a yearly salary of 150k (minimum, up to 175k). My wife and I have always talked about living abroad for a few years as this could be a very enriching experience and we're seriously considering this possibility.\n\nTo give an overview of our current living conditions here's a summary:\n\nWe live in Belgium where we have a house and 3 kids (6, 4 and 3 years old). Total monthly income net is 5k (mainly my job, wife only works a bit on the side) spent as this =&gt; 1k mortgage, 800¬ groceries, 600¬ utilities, 300¬ holidays (provision), 1k savings, 1k3 for the rest\n\nI have a company car so I pay no insurance, no fuel, no repairs (advantage valued at around 900¬ per month). Health is basically free. School is free.\n\nWe live relatively well even though we don't indulge in many luxuries. We eat out like 3 or 4 times per month at most (at kids friendly restaurants)\n\nHow would 150k translate in monthly net? According to the research I did, it would be taxed as such:\n\nFirst $107,651 is taxed at 5.85% =&gt; $5,976, rest is taxed at 6.25% =&gt; $2,646 so total net would be $141,337 or $11,781 monthly. Could someone confirm this?\n\nWould this roughly 12k be enough to support a family of 5? AS far as I've seen a 3 bedroom apartment goes for around 4k or even more. Would this be the case in a kid friendly neighborhood?\n\nI figure the cost of groceries wouldn't be much more expensive but I have no clue about the cost of health and school?\n\nFurthermore my wife worked as a beautician/esthetician (?) and know works part time selling cakes but speaks no English (only French and Spanish). So how easy would it be for her to find something in those areas if needed and how much could it pay?\n\nSo basically the main question is, could we manage it financially?\n\nLast but no least, although I've always had a \"free car\" and it's something really useful where I live, it's not a must if we live in an area well located with good public transportation and nearby facilities.\n\nThank you in advance for taking the time to read all the text and for your answers, it's much appreciated!","subreddit":"AskNYC","comments":409,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/173tcdy/moving_to_nyc_with_kids_with_150k/","_row":"Moving to NYC with kids with 150k"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-05","timestamp":1696543132,"title":"Socialist slice of life anime","text":"Slice of life socialist city, abundant green space and public transportation including high rise modular apartment buildings for optimal sustainability.

(Also more of a statement and not a question)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Question 4) Would other ethnicities or minorities be excluded or have a lower chance of being able to participate in these conferences?\n\nI personally think that all of questions were pretty valid. However, another point of contention comes from the request of public apology. If you watch the entire discussion, the senators and guests from student orgs were overall condescending the entire time: the main senator would interrupt quite a bit, and called the president \"mijo\" (means darling, but in this circumstance, it's diminutive and not appropriate for a senate meeting). He even apologized for lumping the questions together in the video \\[1:18:54\\] of the facebook live.\n\nA bigger issue I see is that while they request $75,000 for sending students to conferences, they very clearly state that \"AS senators would get guaranteed spots to go\"??????, which seems like a clear conflict of interest????? Similarly, when asked where the 75k number came from, they admit that there's no basis for it, calling it a \"magic number\". I think there's a stronger argument to be made that sending a few people to conferences isn't going to be building a community here, which was one of their biggest complaints. Why not have big events and cultural celebrations, bring awareness to these organizations, and build everything here. 75k is a lot of money, but it's probably worth the investment here, and I know for a fact we give that much money and more towards stupid shit like AS retreats and big student orgs that do nothing but host what are essentially parties &gt;:(\n\nI spent a whole hour watching this cringe ass senate meeting. It was stupid, everyone having to fucking keep adding 15 minutes and get a senator to approve this addition and get a second senator to \"second\" the vote. It was a whole lot of shitty bureaucracy, and I hated every moment of it. But there's so much nonsense being posted about this one stupid interaction, I almost think this is a targeted conspiracy to sway public opinion on George Lo, when everyone already hates his guts.\n\nYOU ARE NOT IMMUNE TO PROPAGANDA.","subreddit":"UCSD","comments":16,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/17f6xbo/psa_weird_nonsense_coming_from_as_senators/","_row":"PSA: weird nonsense coming from AS senators wanting an apology (not that george is great)"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-20","timestamp":1697771065,"title":"Dude forgot Tax, Paying population and Surviving on Tax Population","text":"","subreddit":"indiadiscussion","comments":107,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/indiadiscussion/comments/17c19bn/dude_forgot_tax_paying_population_and_surviving/","_row":"Dude forgot Tax, Paying population and Surviving on Tax Population"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-28","timestamp":1695903272,"title":"Are you with me as a native of Bangalore who never want to live there anymore?","text":"My family on both sides have settled in Bangalore over 3 generations before and starting from my grandparents there is hardly anyone we can call family outside of the city. \n\nI've moved abroad years ago but I visit Bangalore atleast 4 times a year to see family.

Fortunately, I have WiFi, so you all have updates.\n\nThis begins the much-requested Sifal spinoff, continuing directly from the events of New York Carnival Chapter 15. Some time has passed, Sifal and Vriss have settled into their new roles within Isif's Rebellion, and now they're about to make the most of the famed Arxur temperamental disposition towards independent autonomous action.\n\n[\\[When First We Met Sifal\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/12yfq9g/new_york_carnival_01_wherein_an_arxur_first/) \\- [\\[When Last We Left Sifal\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/15lf130/new_york_carnival_15_an_arxurs_epilogue_be_the/) \\- [\\[Next\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/17f9m84/new_years_of_conquest_02_all_the_different_and/)\n\n\\----------------------\n\n**Memory Transcription Subject: First Officer Sifal, ARS Bleeding Heart**\n\n*Date \\[standardized human time\\]: Various, 2137*\n\nThe funny thing about transfers of power is how much smoother they go when you\u0019re still visibly dripping with the blood of your predecessor. Sure, the usual handful of ambitious fools all spoke up, each announcing that they alone deserved to be in charge, but for each aspirant there was a full chorus of other soldiers screaming \u001cFuck no, absolutely not\u001d. I think that might have been what fully sealed the deal for our new positions of power: nobody particularly *minded* letting Vriss take charge. The former first officer had a reputation for being orderly, even-keeled, and just. It was a wonderful upgrade over the previous captain\u0019s streaks of sadistic whimsy; such a simple luxury, knowing that you could evade all punishments just by following the rules. And if the calmly efficient Captain Vriss wanted to pick that quiet but competent woman from engineering as his new first officer, well, nobody really minded me either, and who knew efficiency better than an engineer?\n\nAs for the cause for rebellion itself, a lot of the details were above our pay grade. Vriss and I might have had broader visions of what the rebellion meant for the Arxur people, but the average soldier mostly heard that their government, Betterment, was responsible for their hunger, and their superior officer, Chief Hunter Isif, wanted to fix that and feed them. People liked food, and people liked that all they had to do to get it was to keep following the orders of the same commander they had followed for years. In most ways, as far as day to day life on our ship went, nothing really changed. The biggest difference, frankly, was practical: after losing our stationary bases to attacks from Betterment, and after pocketing the Human-Venlil bounty on freed cattle, we found ourselves swapping one resource scarcity for another.\n\n\u001cOkay,\u001d said Captain Vriss. \u001cRun this by me again. What do you mean, we are out of hull patches?\u001d\n\nThe new head of engineering stared at the new Captain\u0019s feet nervously. I never thought I would live to see the day that a man of such mediocre talents could eat well enough to become chubby, but the fool\u0019s slight paunch was, in its own way, inspiring. \u001cI\u0019m sorry, Captain. We haven\u0019t gotten a proper equipment resupply in months. I tried to throw something together using scrap metal and solder, but it\u0019s just not holding against the void of space.\u001d His posture shrank down in shame and fear. \u001cWe just had to seal off the whole compartment. It was just a bunk, thankfully, but a hit to anything important would be catastrophic at this point.\u001d\n\nVriss\u0019s gaze flicked over to me, silently asking for my opinion on whether the engineer was full of shit or not. I shrugged helplessly. The man wasn\u0019t wrong about our supply issues, and I\u0019d have probably tried a similar stopgap solution.\n\n\u001cAlright,\u001d said Vriss. \u001cIt is what it is. Keep the ship steady. I\u0019m going to confer with my first officer and see if we can conjure up a more long-term solution. Sifal, my quarters?\u001d\n\nI nodded, and led the way. I knew the path well. Vriss\u0019s quarters were sparse and mostly book by population--a deliberate affectation, given the existence of holopads. Most Arxur officers preferred ceremonial weapons and trophies, so decorating his quarters in books made a fairly avant-garde statement about what mattered to him. Beyond that, the room was furnished with a simple unordained desk, a few sturdy chairs that were comfortable without being decadent, shelves of clean metal bolted to the walls for stability, and a firm bed that left space for more storage underneath. I walked straight to the bed and sat near the head of it. My captain shut the door behind him, and laid down on the bed, face-up, the back of his weary head resting on my lap.\n\n\u001cAll the food we could ever dream of, and we\u0019re starved for scrap metal,\u001d he said, letting the exhaustion tinge his voice.\n\n\u001cRebellions rarely have the luxury of supplies of any sort,\u001d I said, gently massaging his head. This kind of physical contact was our little indulgence, behind closed doors. Betterment never really condoned love, and even within the rebellion, cultural shifts took time. \u001cThe humans of America describe being short on food and materiel alike while wintering at Valley Forge during their own foundational rebellion.\u001d\n\nVriss\u0019s eyes winced shut. The responsibility for the whole crew was an oppressive pressure. He accepted it, but he didn\u0019t enjoy it. \u001cHow did they win?\u001d\n\nI exhaled, trying to recall. \u001cIn that immediate position? The Battle of Trenton. A desperate night raid while their opponents were intoxicated and celebrating.\u001d\n\nVriss looked bemused. \u001cDesperate raids are all we\u0019ve been doing. We need a new approach if we\u0019re going to survive this.\u001d He shook his head. \u001cAnything else in your human texts?\u001d\n\nWith my free hand, I retrieved my holopad and thumbed through my notes on Sun Tzu. \u001cPeople hate it when you set their things on fire, make sure your troops want the same things that you want, consider the terrain when making plans, stolen materiel is worth five times as much as domestically-produced&\u001d I trailed off, the gears turning in my head. \u001cHey, Vriss, we\u0019re still technically at war with the Federation, aren\u0019t we?\u001d\n\nVriss blinked. \u001cI mean, I suppose so. What, are you suggesting a cattle raid? We don\u0019t need the food, and it\u0019s probably still going to piss the U.N. off even if we\u0019re only targeting Federation outposts.\u001d\n\n\u001cRight,\u001d I said slowly, the start of a plan taking shape. \u001cBut what if we don\u0019t raid them for cattle? We need guns and ships.\u001d\n\nVriss raised an eyebrow. \u001cWould prey-built ships even be useful?\u001d\n\nI shrugged. \u001cFor the spare parts? Yeah, they& they might be.\u001d The more I thought about it, the more it all looked like it added up. \u001cI mean, a hull patch is a hull patch, and our drive cores are all based on Kolshian tech anyway, and it\u0019s not like prey-built missiles share their owners\u0019 cowardice. Shit, this could actually work.\u001d\n\n\u001cWe\u0019d need the perfect target, though,\u001d Vriss pointed out. \u001cFederation-run, but far enough and small enough that the Kolshians would just write it off rather than pull forces away from the main war front to rescue them.\u001d\n\nI flicked open a star map on my holopad, and skimmed around rapidly until an outpost jumped out at me. \u001cHere. This one. It\u0019s called&\u001d It was some gibberish in a prey language, so I just let it translate. \u001cSeaglass. Habitable planet, cosmologically very young, which means a higher concentration of the rarer minerals useful in starship manufacturing. It\u0019s a Nevok-owned mining outpost, but the owners are Federation loyalists, which makes them the worst of both worlds. They\u0019ve refused human protection, but their species accepted it, so the Kolshians probably won\u0019t protect them either out of racist spite. Perfect target.\u001d\n\nVriss nodded, thinking. \u001cSo what\u0019s the actual plan, then? Smash and grab, then scarper before the Federation *or* the Dominion notice we\u0019re there?\u001d\n\nI considered it, but there was a tiny flicker of inspiration drawing my attention to something I\u0019d read. I flipped my holopad back over to my notes, this time on human histories of warfare. \u001cWhat if we took a cue from the Mongols?\u001d I wondered aloud. \u001cThey started their campaign of conquests with raids, but they rapidly switched up their strategies wherever they could get away with it.\u001d I looked Vriss in the eyes. \u001cThey kept a network of tributaries to bankroll their ongoing war effort. Low-maintenance vassals. Any time we show up, the Feds fill our cargo holds with goods, and in exchange, we *don\u0019t* eat them.\u001d\n\nVriss\u0019s brow furrowed in confusion. \u001cBut I just said we probably can\u0019t get away with eating them.\u001d\n\nI chuckled. \u001cThat\u0019s the best part: they don\u0019t know that. In fact, if you look at how much trouble the humans have had with diplomacy? I don\u0019t think the Feds would believe us if we told them. They\u0019re just too convinced that we\u0019re all flesh-starved monsters.\u001d I drummed my fingers idly on the lean muscles of Vriss\u0019s chest. \u001cReally, convincing them that they can pay us off to \u0018spare\u0019 them is going to be the hardest part.\u001d I shrugged. \u001cGuess we\u0019re about to see which Nevok instincts are stronger: their fear of us, or their love of a good deal.\u001d\n\nVriss snorted. \u001c\u0018Your money or your life\u0019 isn\u0019t that good of a deal, Sifal.\u001d\n\n\u001cBest deal *we\u0019ve* ever given them,\u001d I said wryly.\n\nVriss considered the plan. \u001cThat covers the Federation,\u001d he said, \u001cbut what happens if the Dominion catches us?\u001d\n\nI pulled the star map back up. The Dominion had cut our access to their spy stations, obviously, but the U.N.\u0019s cyber warfare specialists had quietly restored it, at least in part. Nevertheless& \u001cIt\u0019s a small colony,\u001d I pointed out. \u001cThe nearest Dominion listening post is a few systems over, monitoring a major trade hub. If we approach Seaglass from the other side, they won\u0019t even know we\u0019re there.\u001d\n\n\u001cSuppose the Dominion is monitoring exports, then,\u001d said Vriss. \u001cWe knock the place over, the exports drop or disappear. The Dominion knows it wasn\u0019t them, so they might send a scouting team to investigate, just in case.\u001d\n\nI shrugged. \u001cThen they\u0019ll find an unremarkable Federation outpost that stopped exporting for some inscrutably prey-brained reason. What are they going to do, talk to them? Ask them if they\u0019ve been conquered lately?\u001d I shook my head. \u001cI don\u0019t think the Dominion would even suspect we\u0019re there. Arxur and prey peacefully working together, even under *severe* duress, is unprecedented.\u001d\n\nVriss was running low on objections, and he knew it as well. \u001cWhat if they raid our new tributaries for cattle?\u001d\n\nI laughed. \u001cWorst case scenario, we lose the colony and try again somewhere else. Easy come, easy go. Best case scenario, the raiders aren\u0019t prepared for any real resistance, and we ambush them while they least expect it.\u001d\n\nI could see the gears turning in Vriss\u0019s head. Nodding decisively, he sat up. \u001cAlright, that settles it, then. We\u0019ll give it a shot. I\u0019ll coordinate attaining orbital superiority over the planet, and you\u0019ll have command of the landing team.\u001d\n\nI reared back in shock. \u001cWhoa, whoa, whoa, why are you giving me the command? I\u0019ve never led a book club before, let alone a landing team!\u001d\n\nVriss smiled and clapped me on the shoulder. \u001cI've been training you for months. You\u0019re ready. Besides, it\u0019s your plan.\u001d\n\nMy eyes stayed wide. \u001cI& and you\u0019re not coming with?\u001d\n\nVriss shook his head. \u001cNeeding a babysitter would only undermine your authority. Besides, you\u0019re the right tool for this job.\u001d\n\n\u001cFor leading a ground assault?\u001d I asked incredulously. \u001cHow do you figure?!\u001d\n\nMy captain waved away my concerns. \u001cPlease. We\u0019re Arxur. Ground assaults against prey aren\u0019t that hard. Trust me from experience: you can pretty much make it up as you go along and still do fine.\u001d Vriss looked at me dead-on, his golden eyes glistening in the dim light. \u001cNo, you\u0019re the right choice for doing something as unprecedented and unconventional as negotiating *actual terms of surrender* with prey. I\u0019m far too traditionally-minded for this, and you\u0019re the Terran-trained social predator. This is *your* mission, First Officer Sifal.\u001d\n\nHe squeezed my shoulder one last time for reassurance. I brushed it aside. It was in my way as I went in for a full hug. I tucked my maw down over his shoulder, wrapping myself around him.\n\n\u001cOne more step towards our happy ending together,\u001d I muttered into his upper back. The first verse of our little call and repeat.\n\n\u001cA clutch of fat hatchlings,\u001d he replied, \u001cand a farmhouse with a workshop.\u001d\n\n\u001cAnd a cat!\u001d I added petulantly, as Vriss chuckled.\n\n\\----------------------\n\nDays of preparation and travel passed. Our small bomber wing dropped out of FTL closer to Seaglass than was typical. The colony\u0019s primary defense was being too small to be worth the dignity or expense of raiding. The whole world was just a couple sprawling company towns near the coast of a craggy supercontinent where the native life hadn\u0019t yet seen fit to crawl out of the sea. If we hadn't been desperate to feed on its tight cluster of mines and factories, this whole mission would have been a rounding error away from launching an orbital raid on one guy\u0019s house. In short, no, they had no defensive perimeter of FTL inhibitors established yet.\n\nOn our side of the equation, we weren\u0019t particularly interested in ramping up their fear of an inevitable defeat by sauntering into the system slowly. We appeared in the sky in an instant, and hit them hard and fast. Very curiously to them, we only hit their long-range comm towers, and we did so with surgical precision. Orbit-to-ground railgun strikes like this were not standard Arxur procedure at all. We had antimatter bombs for surface targets like that. Nevertheless, as their emergency sirens blared, and as the prey scrambled to get their meager squadron of patrol craft off the ground, every ship and bunker in the settlement screeched a warning for a missile targeting lock--a promise to be kept at our leisure--as we hailed them.\n\nWe broadcasted our intentions publicly while we awaited their response. At my advisement, there were no roaring growls in our ultimatum. My lover spoke with the quietly menacing inevitability of a detonator slowly ticking down. \u001cFederation Colony, this is Captain Vriss of the Disruption Wing of the Arxur Rebellion Fleet. We are assuming control over this outpost. Stand down, and your lives may yet be bargained for.\u001d The word choice was a calculated half-truth. If we were very lucky, the prey\u0019s thoughts would leap to the Human-Venlil bounty on cattle. That wasn\u0019t remotely what we had in mind here, but it was a seed of hope for the prey below that they might survive long enough to be ransomed if they surrendered, which& well, in a sense, that part was true. Vriss had primarily balked at the OpSec concerns of letting a whole planet know who we were, but I assured him that for diplomacy to work, they needed to see the faces and hear the names of their occupiers. To accept us as their conquerors and rulers, they first needed to accept us as people. No one bowed to hungering beasts.\n\nThat being said, we weren\u0019t so foolish as to sit around picking our teeth while we waited for their reply. My ground squad was already in descent directly above the colony\u0019s main spaceport and command bunker. It was perhaps a sign of poor redundancy planning, keeping those two so close together, but they\u0019d probably been the first sites constructed, and hadn\u0019t yet been relocated. I\u0019d been given command over an old cattle ship that had been hastily retrofitted as a resupply and tender ship, and now hastily retrofitted *back* into something not entirely unlike an assault transport. It had guns on it, and could carry cargo and/or people aplenty. Its name had been something pointlessly cruel, so I\u0019d hastily renamed it as well to the ARS Brennus. It wasn\u0019t *technically* named after my human mentor, David Brenner, but I liked to imagine that it was.\n\n\u001cWhy \u0018Brennus\u0019?\u001d asked Laza, my second on the squad, awkwardly pronouncing a name from a language and culture she\u0019d never studied. We were all awkwardly gathered in the main cargo bay in full gear, waiting for the ground to meet us. It wasn\u0019t the worst time for a short speech.\n\n\u001cOld human warlord who caught my interest while I was reading their histories,\u001d I said. I kept my voice casual, but just loud enough to be overheard by anyone who wished to. \u001cThe city of Rome was the seat of power of a vast ancient human empire. For nearly a thousand years, from the city\u0019s founding to its fall, it was conquered only once, by some supposedly uncivilized barbarian named Brennus that Rome had underestimated.\u001d I chuckled. \u001cThe city was forced to *purchase* his mercy with an astonishing weight in precious metals. The barbarians made a grand show of it, too. They erected an enormous set of scales, with weights on one side, and space for their payment on the other. When both sides of the scales were evened out, the price was paid. The Romans noticed, however, that the weights were heavier than agreed upon. They tried to argue. \u0018This is unfair!\u0019 they cried.\u001d\n\nI slowly drew my fancy new ceremonial officer\u0019s sword, holding its blade out before my eyes. As David once did, I could see every inch of my steel without taking my eyes off of the warrior in front of me. \u001cDo you know what the great warlord Brennus said in response to their complaints?\u001d I savored the eyes watching me with rapt attention. I held my sword out by its hilt in front of me, and let go. It clattered to the ground loudly. The few people who hadn\u0019t been paying attention jumped, startled, and I let my voice rise to a crescendo. \u001cHe dropped his *sword* atop the weights, increasing the price of his mercy, and said \u0018Vae victis!\u0019 Woe to the conquered!\u001d\n\nAn enthused cheer erupted from my assembled troops. Gods of Old, I could *kiss* David for the gifts of knowledge he\u0019d given me. When you broke it down and explained it in writing, the rhythm of a good rousing speech was practically a *math formula*. Build up a beat, raise the intensity, ask a question, pause for a breath, and then let the answer hit them like a *sledgehammer*. Gods, everything the humans did was fucking *music*.\n\nStart with the known and conventional, then reverse it for dramatic effect. \u001cThe lives of the prey are *forfeit*, this is true!\u001d I shouted to the room. \u001cBut we do not *want* their lives!\u001d\n\nRepeat the shape, build upon the rhythm inherent in reversal. \u001cWe are here today, not for their blood, but for their steel!\u001d\n\nRepetition, repetition, repetition. \u001cWhat need have we for flesh? We have eaten well today, and we have eaten well yesterday, and you may yet have faith that we will eat well tomorrow!\u001d\n\nBuild to the crescendo, and then hit them with the one point that\u0019s not like the others. \u001cIt is their *wealth* today that we hunger for, and their *service* towards our glorious cause! Today, we debut a new form of conquest!\u001d\n\n*Vriss was right,* I mused, as I savored the roar of adulation from dozens of footsoldiers, and tried to avoid recalling the Greco-Roman concept of hubris. *Leading a ground assault against the prey is really fucking easy.*","subreddit":"NatureofPredators","comments":48,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/179vdap/new_years_of_conquest_01_wherein_sifal_plans_the/","_row":"New Years of Conquest 01 (Wherein Sifal Plans the Subjugation of Her Very First Planet)"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-18","timestamp":1697651234,"title":"[Effort Post] - Isometric turn-based MMORPG : Try them, you won't regret it","text":"(Flair might be incorrect, I'm not really used to post that kind of post, in here, or in reddit in general)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***TLDR*** *: Give Wakfu, the MMORPG a try.

If you need informations on what the heck is that game, check the post, or check their website :* [*https://www.wakfu.com/en/mmorpg*](https://www.wakfu.com/en/mmorpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGreeting fellow gamers,\n\nBuckle up, this is a long one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, I'm French, so my english might be faulty sometimes, I apologize. \n\nHope it will still be understandable. \n\n# Introduction and why I'm here\n\nI've been following this sub from afar for quite some time. Like a lot of you, hoping to find MMORPG's suggestions, to clench my thirst.\n\nA few weeks ago, Wakfu, the MMORPG I grew up on announced a special server opening, and A LOT of old players and new players alike are rejoining the game to play it. \n\nThose servers are special. They are called \"mono-account\". \n\nThey DO NOT ALLOW multi-accounts on the same IP. (with some lee-way for brothers, sisters etc. Do not worry. What is meant is you don't play, yourself, multiple accounts or characters).\n\nIt is a mechanic that pretty much taken for granted on that game, which reduced heavily the interactions with other players. The game is built around groups and having to play together, and especially communicate together (no automatic dungeon party for example). It is well known by the developer and the players that people tend to have multiple account to be their own play-buddy (Even the developer allowed you to play up to 3 characters of the same account at the same time).\n\nJust open 5 other windows, and play them all together in a team. Since it's a tactical turn-based game, that's not an issue. That specific new server does not allow that, **bringing back that sweet, sweet social right back into the game.**\n\nThere is currently around 50 000 people that announced (in a public poll from the game-vompany themselves) they would \\*at least\\* try that new server. 2/3rd of that are french. 1/3rd are international players. They will have one server dedicated to each third, so 2 french and one international.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why am I doing this (probably) long post ?**\n\nBecause I want to put that game forward, internationally. It's a very well known game in France, and would greatly benefit from and to international players, because it kinda is a one-of-a-kind experience.\n\nI'm going to try to be expansive on the content of the game, so you know what we are dealing with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*NOTE : I'm not paid, influencer or even linked to that game ever. I'm just a big fan, and think that kind of posts on that subreddit should become the norm. Passionate people talking about their favorite MMORPGs, getting more people into it. The more, the merrier !*\n\n*NOTE 2 : I wrote this post on a whim. I'm not that good at organizing information, nor explaining things. I hope you will be able to feel the passion more than read it. Please try the game(s) for yourself.*\n\n*NOTE 3 : Sorry, all the screenshots are in French, and my english is broken. :(*\n\n# \n\n# \n\n# \n\n# Ankama games and the Krosmoz\n\nAnkama games is a French studio that have been very active for the past 20 years. With currently 3 MMORPG's still running and going strong under their belt, they are the Jagex (Runescape) equivalent in France. A gigantic impact on a particular generation, and a loved video games company by players.\n\nThey spent a lot of time carefully crafting an original universe, based on a temporality that globally makes sense, monsters, gods, and explaining in universe the origin of the different roles (healer, dpt etc) by the use of classes.\n\nYou can check their universe wiki on this website : \n\n[https://krosmoz.fandom.com/wiki/Krosmoz](https://krosmoz.fandom.com/wiki/Krosmoz)\n\nThis creation is so expansive that they were able to base tons of games on it, multiple movies and multiples animated shows. (The stories of Kerubim, Wakfu the animated serie (available on Netflix, at least french netflix, and I think US aswell), Judith the movie, with another one on the way).\n\nP.S : I highly recommend the Wakfu show, just for the excellent writing, in particular on the villain side. The animation is special and need some time to get used-to, but trust me, the writing of those villains is exquisite. Especially if you long villains having actual motives you can relate to.\n\n# Basic gameplay system\n\nThis part is more of a warning. I will present the BASICS you will find in all 3 MMORPG I'll be talking about in this post. They WILL have differences that I'll go expansively in details on, in the different sections.\n\nThose games are **ISOMETRIC TURN-BASED GAMES.**\n\nThey are **MEANT** to be a tactical / strategic experience to their core.\n\n[Screenshot from Wakfu \\(with a tactical visual mode\\)](https://preview.redd.it/d3ayzh9zczub1.png?width=1911&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4367620d671f4eccd27844db92cc2f2f53b9e82d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll those games work in a grid like system. You play your turn, spend your movement points (near the center in green), spend your action points (near the center in dark blue + special points in light blue), end your turn, let the other play, the AI play, and it's your turn again. Rince and repeat until one team is dead (life of your character on the hearth in the middle. The green bar is irrelevant here). \n\nPretty simple right ? You need to enjoy that idea if you want to enjoy those games, because it will be hard to avoid (Unless you just fully roleplay, in that case, who cares about mechanics).\n\nThe universe/genre, and that system are what's common between those 3 games. Most of the other mechanics, even down to the kind of spell you can launch, are different.\n\nLet's get into the specifics now.\n\n# Dofus\n\nDofus is their first MMORPG. It is placed at the beginning of the timeline story-wise. You can see Dofus like OSRS. It's old graphics, it's very farm intensive, but still going strong, very strong. I highly recommend checking it out, even if I'm here to talk more about it's\" spiritual successor\" (will talk more about why there are quotation marks later).\n\nDofus has a lot of \"old games\" mechanics. It is meant to be exact, predictable. Every damage is precisely calculated. The world is not continuous but rather a collection of little squares stuck together to form a coherent ensemble. You go from map to map, essentially, with a fixed camera for each \"map\".\n\nTo be honest, I barely touched that game. So I'm not that qualified to talk about it. It is a very interesting game still, and has the most active community of them all. Just know that it will probably be mostly french, as this game has very little international community. Wakfu and Waven are different, the first because of the show mostly, and the second because it's built this way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Starting zone of Dofus](https://preview.redd.it/nck7qperdzub1.png?width=1933&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2b7a4080774b3f0e11ff1640394978b7cd84227)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A fight](https://preview.redd.it/voi370rudzub1.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c94b074869c443185e96b4a9ac756185b6382556)\n\n# Wakfu\n\nThis is why I made this post, so I'm going to be very thorough.\n\n**Classes &amp; Combat**\n\n[https://www.wakfu.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/classes](https://www.wakfu.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/classes)\n\nIn this game, there is no \"warrior\", \"mage\", \"archer\" exactly. Well, there is, but it's more for the sake of having them, rather than making them the center piece. The whole game is built on a plethora of classes, and **ALL OF THEM are viable options**. There is no perfect response, not even in the playstyle, mostly because the game is way too big for one playstyle to win in every situation. \n\nClasses are mostly differentiated by their role (support, dps distance, dps melee, boost, placement etc), their playstyle, and the level of tactics you have to engage to play them.\n\nExample :\n\nCra is, on appearance, a very easy class to play. It's a classic archer, very good in DPS. You can just hit the enemy with some arrows spells, and end it at that. You can also use beacons, and shoot them, so it hits in a zone. You can also play it as a kite. Overall, a pretty easy class, but like all of them, easy to play, hard to master. Technically a good option to start the game. \n\nXelor is another class you can play. They are a mage that controls time, essentially. They will spend most of their time managing their action points, removing them to others, adding some more to themselves. Play with a mechanic where they do more damage only on turns that are even (turn 2, 4, 6 etc), mimicking a clock.\n\nOsamodas is a class of summoner where you have to capture ACTUAL MONSTERS in the game, fight them, like pokemon, so they end up in your deck. You will then be able to use their ability to fight whatever you want later. You have a lot of abilities to boost your invocations, but can also have the playstyle where you totally forget about using summons, boost yourself, transform into a dragon, and hit like a truck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe versatility of classes, the amount of care the developers have put into every single mechanic to make them all feel like unique classes and playstyle, it's just absolutely gorgeous to see. Being able to witness a class, Eniripsa, who is BUILT to be a healer, being played as offensive because of **ONE OPTIONAL SPELL** that transform every healing capability into an damaging one at the drop of a hat, and being the most broken damaging class in PvP at some point. That's just a treat. When you witness that kind of gameplay, you just end up in awe of how weird that game, how complex, and how optimized and inventive people can be.\n\nSince I play that class, I can show you what Xelor looks like :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A xelor turn](https://preview.redd.it/cs71eqsiizub1.png?width=1434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cd8fb3ee6ad7e907ad50006f7c3ec9e3afbe9f8)\n\nYou probably do not understand anything, but a whole lot is going on. At the bottom, the available spells. Damage, description, effects, range, cost, everything is written there. It's how and when you use them that's important. For the Xelor case in particular, they can put a clock (that weird pointy thing in the middle), and travel along the hours displayed around for essentially free. \n\nSome interesting facts : \n\n\\- Orientation of your character matters. You will take more damage if you're hit from the back or from the side.\n\n\\- Every class has passive spells aswell, see below. They are tailored to **CHANGE THE GAMEPLAY OF YOUR CLASS IN A DEEP WAY**. Hence why I said earlier, you will **NEVER** see two people play exactly the same way. They will have different gear, different spell deck, or different passives, or even bonuses on their gear you don't have. More on that later.\n\n\\- Most classes can have every role. It's not a guarantee, and some classes will be better at, let's say, healing than others. But if you build it right, there is like 80% of classes that can heal / boost reasonably well. 80% of classes that can DPS reasonably well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The main spells of a Xelor. Left is my deck, what I chose to have available during combat. Right is what is available to me. My deck, active and passive included, expands as I have more level \\(Niv = Lvl\\). They are fixed per class, and are unlocked by leveling aswell.](https://preview.redd.it/g4p7e0l3jzub1.png?width=642&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42c561d9fba413695426d46d67a32b02935a19d7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The passive spells of the Xelor. Most of those will have a big impact on your gameplay. For example, the 2nd one I have equipped to the left, in \\\\\"passifs\\\\\" \\(passives\\) part, with the big stars and XIII, will remove some movement points and give me huge bonuses elsewhere. It changed fundamentally how I play it, since i can't move that much anymore, and have to rely on other means included in the class \\(the weird pointy clock for example\\).](https://preview.redd.it/nqwc67lbjzub1.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51d18406863894003db9854fc1e78e467456e146)\n\nAn important note : The max level has always been classically 200 in Ankama games. In Wakfu, it is 230 right now, because of frequent end-game updates. Honestly, the leveling is not problematic. What might drag you down (well, mostly near end-game) is playing alone, definitely. Join a guild, be social. It's the main goal of those games, and they are meant to be played with other people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1-130 is a breeze.\n\n130-140 has always been known as the most difficult part, but that has been covered in \"\"recent\"\" updates. (2-3 years ago)\n\n140-170 is fine, a bit long. That's where you actually find out it's a pure multiplayer game, and leveling up alone become actually difficult.\n\n170+ same as before, longer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis game is not like World Of Warcraft. It is not meant to be rushed, and \"actually play the game\" when you reach max level. Wakfu makes the whole experience interesting along the way, and leveling IS the game. Reaching the end game is actually allowing yourself more time and resources to go back into the meat of leveling, with your new ideas and gameplay (Check the stasis system in \"More Combat Systems\").\n\n**Exploration**\n\nThe world is very big. You always have somewhere to be, and something to do.\n\nFrom mountain peaks, to the dark world. To literally heavens to a pirate beach. From a volcano to a dracula-like vibe. Everything is in there. And monsters follow that pattern in a heartbeat.\n\nNote : Unlike Dofus, the game is a continuous map. It's not separated in little squares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The portal to Hell](https://preview.redd.it/cqwqj24bgzub1.png?width=1266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12c188bddc3df34ff3df23ccaa0e971449226b6a)\n\n[Welcome to Moon's beach !](https://preview.redd.it/oj5rnn0hgzub1.png?width=1171&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24bb26fcb263f920730232e9e42f30ca3b48cc16)\n\n[Theme park !](https://preview.redd.it/gfxqmlkogzub1.png?width=1361&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=091efd5dd01ec6b017a735a3ed82e2e25e43c4bf)\n\n[Town of the god of assassins \\(Sram, a class you can play\\)](https://preview.redd.it/l5229yfsgzub1.png?width=1292&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=704396b8945c926c032462e9551a9b174227c552)\n\n[Land of the golden Enutrof \\(A class you can play comprised of old people very interested in riches.

If you're more of a craftman, like to work with your hands, and sell the armor you make ? No worries, Wakfu got you covered !\n\n150 levels per job (pretty much), ranging from fishing, to mining to collect resources, and use those resources in armor and weapon making, gear, to make bread and food, or just plain old furniture !\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Cabinetry job to build furniture, bags to transport more equipements, keys to access guarded content, and ways to reduce random bonuses on equipments.](https://preview.redd.it/4mgkkpoghzub1.png?width=762&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e9aca26630eb4fb84af1a17a515d6374d79ae6d)\n\n[Weapon master to build your own weapons, or upgrade weapons you got from monsters \\/ dungeons !](https://preview.redd.it/2buobt0qhzub1.png?width=777&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ad0ab81b91edb6b2505ffb7ed20d34841aae422)\n\n[Jewelery to craft rings and amulets specifically. \\(Most jobs are limited to one or two elements of the available equippable gear, that's why most are important, even if not required\\)](https://preview.redd.it/esbo0qzshzub1.png?width=770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b79cc069618f9ebe49d5c19493fa4475ac15c6b2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe collecting of resources is very similar (at least from what I know) to most games. You click, you wait for an action to finish, and you're done. A few specifities though :\n\n\\- You can own equipment to increase your yield and temporary bonuses. (it's optimizable is what I mean)\n\n\\- Some resources are randomly shiny. That's rare version of that resource, and will be used for widely different uses. Those are usually looked after in the market, or used in important crafts.\n\nNOTE : Most people don't and don't need to have most of their jobs to the max level. I just enjoy that part of the game especially. This is not a \"normal\" beginner account. Also very old player, that helps to know some methods / techniques.\n\nIn terms of economy, it's very simple. Complete quests, or sell stuff on the market place (or craft money by itself with the mining job). The economy is still manageable and not hyper-inflated, with absolute last gear content, fully optimized (which requires that exact same extremely rare item times 2 or 3 to be destroyed for parts used to upgrade the one sold), amounting to around 100 millions, and the market place quickly going down the 20 millions range as soon as you check the 50th most priced items on there. (Hope that makes sense, again, not english native)\n\n[A screenshot of the marketplace. It goes down 50 millions in the first 10 items most priced in the whole game, which give you an idea of how much 100 millions sold is an outlier.](https://preview.redd.it/sy3tayp7kzub1.png?width=748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c10461da80db1ab445175993bc43b53ce8607ddc)\n\nNOTE : There is a whole part of the game I have not talked about : Ecology. Players actually manage the mob spawning, the type of plants depending on the location etc. They plant their own plants and trees, make sure it's not too much. Spawn mobs they killed etc. Obviously, they will respawn naturally, but there is a job to manage mob spawn aswell ! Do not worry, we have never been in a case where a specie has been wiped out. Toxic behaviour happen, but the game is well done, and that problem never arises. (Same for stealing what you plant, you have priority as the one who planted). **Griefers &amp; PK are NOT a problem that exists in that game.**\n\n**Personalization &amp; cosmetics**\n\nThis game has tons of fun things attached to it's personalization system. First, obvisouly, you can personalize your own characters. It's an isometric game, you won't see yourself often under all that gear, hence why it's really basic (a few haircuts, colors of the outfit, skin color, eye color, and a few decorative things on the outfit). But still, you can.\n\nWhat I want to talk about is everything else.\n\nHave you ever wanted to flex, or enjoy cosmetics ? Animations, ways of moving, cool mounts, titles ? Your own little home you can decorate with items you actually made yourself ? A mini-world just for you ? A fully customizable mini-world with houses for your guild ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[World owned by a medium Guild](https://preview.redd.it/cl79rbrmxzub1.png?width=1263&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1db9e137f022eeabfccea68b0da3a8eeceb34a8b)\n\nAnd you know what's cool about it ? Absolutely nothing is really gated with money. Everything (most of it) is attainable in game (Meaning there will almost always be one that sell shop-only costumes and stuff). In general :\n\n\\- 95% of auras are linked to achievements/items in game\n\n\\- 5% of costumes are linked to quests\n\n\\- Furniture is yours to build (or to buy in game)\n\n\\- Upgrading your personal home is stupidly easy in game (You can only upgrade the size pretty much)\n\n\\- Guilds and everything related to them are related to actions and missions in game\n\nAs you can probably notice, a lot of cosmetics are bound to an in-game shop using real currency (Developers gotta get paid). But there is a catch, in multiple ways. First, a LOT of people just resell those on the market, most of the time at affordable prices. Second, you can buy in game shop currency with in-game money. Check the Monetization part for more information, because it's quite important to know if a game is pay to win before getting into a game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[My own personal little home. You can only change what's on the floor, change the type of floor, and what you put on it.

It's a tactic game after all. Sometimes, you will have to be in certain locations, have certain items, hit with certain elements, to make the dungeon possible. And obviously, the more end-game a dungeon gets, the more complicated the mechanics gets as well.\n\nOne very interesting addition that Wakfu has made, and that I've seen nowhere, is the system of Stasis (named after the energy of destruction, in opposite of wakfu, which is the energy of creation, in that universe).\n\nWhat it does is that it boost monsters, add new mechanics to a dungeon. And it can go up to stasis 50 (considering putting a dungeon stasis 10 is boosting health points by 1100% and damage by 260%, and the loot by 220%). Better than that, you can play a dungeon in competitive mode, or in \"modulated\" mode, forcing your character to level down temporarily to the level of the dungeon (and yet you still make experience that would level up your real level). Now, EVERY DUNGEON in the game is interesting to do, whatever level you have. Do you want to play with your beginner friends ? Just level down your character temporarily, and play at their level. \n\nYou will always have a challenge, even with the lowest dungeons, in your end-game. Always.\n\n**Monetization**\n\nThe moment everyone has been waiting for. It's an important case, and I'll be honest on this one.\n\n***This game is not pay to win.***\n\nThere are a few things that might be suspicious at first. The most obvious being the possibility of buying in game currency wih real money (you buy an item with real money that grants you shop currency, and sell it for in-game currency). Trust me. It's absolutely not game breaking, and usually barely worth it for the seller. That system is actually very interesting because it gives you shop currency to buy stuff without spending a cent on the game, for a price that's very achievable as long as you know the economy / what you are doing. It's kinda like World of Warcraft tokens, but supercharged, since you can spend that on whatever you want in the shop. A booster (see below), cosmetics, or whatever.\n\nOther than that, it's mostly pure cosmetic shop. The few items that could give an advantage (The biggest bag to carry more items for example, have an equivalent you can craft, and are very easily buyable on the marketplace (or even in the actual shop, if you buy shop currency to someone who sells it for in game currency). You can also buy more storage in your personal house. Storage is to me the most game breaking part of all, because I'm a resource gatherer and collector, and that game is so massive it's hard to have the room to store all of my things / resources. For normal players, what's given for free is fine. You can also buy ways to level up your pets faster, or some experience bottle to get a temporary boost, but let's be honest, both are clearly not worth it and barely sells.\n\n**That game is FREE TO PLAY. ALL UPDATES ARE FREE, WITHOUT EXCEPTION. NO EXTENSION OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.** You can buy a booster that will boost in a very significant way the leveling process, both in jobs (50%) and in levels (50%). You will also have a 25% chance of getting more loot. You also get access to the system that allows you to play up to 3 characters on the same account.  It also allows you to restat for free indefinitely, something you can do without booster in the game by following a quest that asks you quite a long farm. (or a bit of money if you buy the items you need to complete the quest).\n\nWhat I want to say is that the booster is not a necessity, it's an actual help. Not a masquerade of \"You can do something in that game, but you will have to farm 10 000 years to get it\" kind of way. The booster does what his name implies. It boosts you. It doesn't give you access to anything that is locked, either soft or hard, by playing without booster.\n\nIt's sold around 6 ¬ per month, and around 1 of those items you can buy for in-game currency to obtain shop currency. It tends to \"become necessary\" close to the end of the game for most people, because the leveling can get rough and quite long, but to be absolutely honest, most people just don't use everything they have. With all the daily quests available, the dungeons, the guilds etc, you can easily level up quite efficiently, again, if you know what you're doing, without having to pay a single cent. *And AGAIN, you can buy that booster with shop currency, which can be bough with in game currency, and is quite affordable.*\n\nNOTE : On the mono-account server, the booster lose the access to the system of playing multiple characters of the same account at the same time (for obvious reasons), and insteand bumps up the experience in jobs (100%) and levels bonuses (100%).\n\n# Waven\n\nI will not talk extensively of that game. It's still a beta, it's not really a MMORPG (even if it claims it is, it does not play like one), and feels more like a very individual / mobile experience. I would not really recommend it. Still a great and cute game, it looks gorgeous, but it still need a whole lot of work. Which makes sense, it's their last and most recent game. \n\n# End word \n\nThank you for reading.\n\nPlease give a try to those games. Especially Wakfu (Still wanted to mention the existence of the others just in case you could be interested, but let's be honest.

Some of those rules are reasonable, some are not. But the real issue so often comes back to \u001cmy partner is not treating me kindly\u001d which is a different issue from \u001cMy partner didn\u0019t follow a rule we have.\u001d \n\n**If you want to avoid doing harm, one is far better off thinking about how one\u0019s actions might effect one\u0019s partner** than to just tick off whether or not the action was against the rules. And if your partner didn\u0019t do that, the issue isn\u0019t whether or not something was against the rules - the issue is that your partner isn\u0019t thinking about your wellbeing and you may want to think about why when figuring out your course of action. \n\nI\u0019m not saying that there isn\u0019t a place for rules - they can fill an important niche. Rules can work really well to address the specific things that people are uncomfortable with that may not be universal. They can help people who are building their relationship judgement skills by supplementing ambiguity with a concrete list. They work for things like: \n- Knowing about changes in STI profile risk before being exposed to that risk (and yeah, this is nearly universal)\n- Not having sex with a partner in a bed one shares with another partner \n- Not having overnights without advanced warning\n- Messy lists\n\nBut **no set of rules is going to fix that your partner doesn\u0019t care about your wellbeing**. No set of rules will encompass every scenario where a partner might cause you pain, or you might cause your partner pain. There will always be scenarios that did not get covered off by a reasonable rules list, like:\n- Does the no sex in the shared bed rule apply if only their hands are on the bed but their body isn\u0019t?\n- If I make it back into the bed I share with my NP 3 minutes before my NP\u0019s alarm goes off, does that count as not having had an overnight? \n- If there is a legitimate reason that getting home from a partner\u0019s place (public transport is disrupted, car won\u0019t start, I have food poisoning and cannot seperate myself from the toilet, etc.) is extra challenging am I violating the rules if I stay over? If I stay over, do i need to sleep on the sofa, or can I share their bed? \n- My nesting partner and I never specifically said no overnights. Can I stay over without telling them in advance? \n- My new clearly problematic partner wasn\u0019t on the messy list, so I can keep dating them even though they stole my other partner\u0019s cat and threatened to destroy their life, right? \n\nThe other element of rules is that they should not be used to unfairly control your partner. If you cannot trust your partner to behave responsibly in an open relationship, you can\u0019t fix that with rules either. And if you\u0019re up for being open, you need to keep your rules sensible.","subreddit":"polyamory","comments":63,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/17abwoj/no_set_of_rules_is_a_substitute_for_basic_human/","_row":"No set of rules is a substitute for basic human decency"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-01","timestamp":1696136320,"title":"Sharing some advice that helped me in the past","text":"Idk if it comes under mom talk but really wanted to share some advice that personally helped me in my life. Now, this might not help everyone or probably most of it is already known by y\u0019all, but i hope this also reached someone who might need it!! \nThere is no specific order, just a random one.\n\n1. Always take your skincare upto your breasts. When you are applying body lotion, make sure to apply it to your chest as well. in this case, massaging it will really help you a lot. This makes our neck to chest area really soft and glowing. Also use body lotion to your hands and toes so they don\u0019t crack. Do it in winter definitely. \n\n2. USE SUNSCREEN. Can\u0019t stress enough on this!! I had acne a year ago. Used some medicines and sunscreen everyday!! now my skin is GLOWING. literally glowing \n\n3. Do not send Nudes to anyone. If you get too horny also, maybe send without your face. with a undetectable background. DO NOT SEND IT WITH FACE. TO ANYONE. EVEN IF YOU LOVE THEM OR ARE MARRIED TO THEM. Not being negative but you never know when a person can turn against you. check yt!! there are so many incidents where husband has shared nudes with his friends. OR SOMEONE takes his phone for using it and comes across your nudes& they might try and send it to themselves!!! NEVER SEND NUDES. \n\n4. Learn how to drive. It might be intimidating but if you do have a private vehicle, it\u0019s better to learn how to drive. \nNow, if something happens to someone at your home, you can take them immediately instead of waiting for a cab or an ambulance. \n\n5. If you have a car, learn basic stuff like changing tyres etc. \n\n6. Learn basic cooking (idk complex cooking tbh but you can learn it from yt. but you can\u0019t learn how to drive a car from yt and then do it in reality!) \n\n7. When you\u0019re going out for a date, please make sure to carry a pepper spray. PLEASE BE CAREFUL. Be aware of your surroundings, do not drink or eat anything you think might be spiked. \n\n8. LISTEN TO YOUR SIXTH SENSE. LISTEN TO YOUR INTUITION. most of the times it is never wrong. Feel danger? RUN. Bad vibes from someone? RUN. \n\n9. Observe your surroundings when you are outside. Be careful!!\n\n10. Wear whatever type of clothes you want: shorts, mini skirts, tank tops, crop top etc. BUT if you are travelling in a public transport, or cab etc, always cover yourself!! Put on a long skirt or a sweater on top. (i bought a buttonup long frock that i wear while travelling and remove it after i reach my destination.) And only go to places where you\u0019re sure you\u0019ll feel safe. \n\n11. It is never your mistake if someone tries to do something to you against your will. But women, please try to be strong. Don\u0019t hesitate to do anything bad to the attacker. Kick his balls/ Pull her hair really hard/ Use that pepper spray in thier eyes etc. \n\n12. Buy quality clothes. Do not buy less quality ones if you can afford quality ones. (i\u0019m talking about the people who will buy less quality ones cause they\u0019re cheaper. so that they can buy in more quantity.) \n\n13. If you aren\u0019t an excessive shopper, try to add 1-2 pairs of clothes each month to your wardrobe. \n\n14. Drink 3-4 litres of water everyday and add a little fibre to your food. If you\u0019re non vegetarian, add at least 2-3 eggs!!\n\n15. I know us girls go on diets and stuff. If you do happen to be on a diet etc (i\u0019m taking to omad, adf etc. the extreme ones) make sure to drink enough water, AND HAVE TABLETS. Good quality Multivitamin tablets. (i take multivitamins and fish oil)\n\n16. When your parents tell you something, try to understand why they\u0019re saying it. Think from their pov. \n\n17. Buy good quality jewellery to use with different outfits if you go out frequently!! \n\n18. DO NOT DO ANYTHING AGAINST YOUR WILL. Don\u0019t want to go to the date? Cancel it. It is that simple!!\n\n19. Try to be financially independent. If you are getting married or something, i heard it is better to have seperate accounts and probably one joint account. \n\n20. Don\u0019t have babies if you are not ready. F the society. It is okay to not have babies if you aren\u0019t ready. Take your time. \n\n21. Smell good. Use good perfumes! But. better than looking out smelling good is being confident!! \n\n22. If you\u0019re uncomfortable with your body hair (which is a completely normal thing.) wax or shave!! use face razor for face and body razor for body. \n\n23. Soap your body after you are done with your headbath. Then, the chemicals will get drained as well. \n\n24. Use hair conditioner at all costs every time you headbath and use heat protection products EVERYTIME you use straightener or curler etc. \n\n25. NO ONE. I SWEAR NO ONE IS WORTH MORE THAN YOUR OWN SELF. DON\u0019T LET ANYONE DISRESPECT YOU. VALUE YOUR SELF RESPECT. \n\nPeople have added more in the comments\n\na. Before you have sex with anyone, make sure to get their Aids/HIV tested. DO NOT HAVE SEX WITHOUT IT. NO MATTER HOW HORNY. \n\nb. Double cleanse. At night, after you have applied make up for the whole day or even if it was for a few hours, DOUBLE CLEANSE.

Only after I took down the original post did I realize this could have been solved via editing. I'm beginning to sense a pattern here, and it's not one I like.\n\n\\---\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/175pe7x/earth_is_a_lost_colony_1/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/175ty9h/earth_is_a_lost_colony_3/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/17d86zj/earth_is_a_lost_colony_5/)\n\nChapter Four: New Enemy, Same War\n\nSergeant Kaydanovsky, now Cadet Kaydanovsky, had just been given a great honor. Fifteen million other soldiers had also received this honor. One month ago, the nations these soldiers had fought for had all joined forces when the Protectorate of Earth was officially formed. Resistance was fierce for the first few weeks, and the move to integrate all of Earth\u0019s nations was hardly popular, but that was the Coalition doctrine. Vitram, thankfully, had managed to salvage the situation with her diplomatic skills and the help of newly promoted Protectoral Governor Aavik.\n\nAdmiral Jedik\u0019s plan, to put power armored marines on every street corner and integrate humanity by force, was disregarded as too aggressive. Instead, Vitram chose to use soft power, the kind not even a thousand warships could properly project. She brokered peace deals that, while never entirely satisfactory, did wonders to ease international tensions. She rewarded nations that supported her with technology, resources, and other favors. She let the UN, with a host of newly-acquired powers, be her boots on the ground rather than deploying an occupation force herself. The one thing the Republic was unashamed to do on its own was provide aid to those in need, distributing medicine, food, and other essential supplies to where they were needed most.\n\nIt would have been political suicide to integrate every nation into the Republic. The bad blood between them would have thrown the Protectorate into a civil war, and indeed, small-scale conflicts were already raging. Instead, what Vitram and Aavik agreed on was to make the Protectorate a coalition of independent nations that all worked toward a common goal. There was still conflict, but Vitram had made it absolutely clear that the Alliance was the greater evil here. That, along with a strong central authority to keep peace, made sure this conflict was resolved with words and not weapons.\n\nThe Republic\u0019s arrival had made poverty and hunger things of the past on Earth. They had bolstered the United Nations, making it a central authority strong enough to resolve disputes between nations but not strong enough to stifle their freedom. They had intervened only when necessary to stop bloodshed or suffering, and they had never attempted to oppress the people of Earth or cow them with military might. Vitram\u0019s promise held true in that the freedoms Earth\u0019s nations held were restricted as little as possible. In the most cooperative cases, there were no restrictions at all. There were no jackbooted marines on every corner. There were no public executions or mass arrests. There were no mysterious disappearances or \u0018tragic accidents\u0019, even to those who staunchly opposed the new Earth.\n\nAll in all, Kaydanovsky approved of his new overlords.\n\nAn unintended side effect of said overlords\u0019 arrival was a massive increase in certain types of art, which the Republic took with a collective tired sigh. Some things were inevitable.\n\nA very much intended effect of the Ierads\u0019 arrival was the modernization of Earth\u0019s economy, government, and military, which the Republic had directly caused. The inefficient and competitive bureaucracy that had existed between Earth\u0019s nations was replaced with a smooth, cooperative Coalition method of doing things. While modernizing every last factory and farm on Earth would take at least a year, logistics was something that could be instantly improved.\n\nThe very first field to see the results of these upgrades was that of the military, since that was the sole reason the Republic came at all. The Protectorate of Earth was under Republic protection, hence the name, and that was evident in the way said Republic was aiding its growth. The planetary militaries of Earth were split between a garrison force and an expeditionary force, and both were being modernized and trained by the RDF. Orbital infrastructure was even now being set up to support the fielding of a space navy, and pre-made defensive platforms were being set up in high orbit of Earth as a flimsy screen against any assault, Coalition or otherwise.\n\nThe Ierad Republic trusted the people of Earth, now officially called Terrans, out of necessity. Most of the Coalition did not trust them at all.\n\nEven still, most species were logical enough to see the reason in letting others fight their battles for them. They wished the Republic the best in its efforts, even while they rallied an extermination fleet in case it should fail. While a thousand mighty warships held point in orbit of Alpha Centauri, five hundred hulking troopships hurtled through their wormholes to the fortress world of Iera Prime.\n\nCadet Kaydanovsky, as well as fifteen million other soldiers, were packed like sardines inside those troopships.\n\nThe world dropped out from underneath him all of a sudden, as it did for the crews and cargo of a thousand Republic heavy troop transports. Large enough to eclipse even the most formidable battleship, interstellar troopships were meant to transport as many soldiers as possible as fast as possible to the front lines of the war. They could fit even small warships into their colossal cargo holds, and their troop transport decks could transport thirty thousand soldiers at a time. They were built solely for speed and cargo space, sparing no space for defensive armaments or even any comforts beyond the most basic. A good Aegis generator was too expensive to qualify, and so Kaydanovsky nearly hurled as he was ripped back into our universe.\n\n\u001cBreathe, man, breathe.\u001d said a fellow soldier. He was originally from the Latvian special forces, and his nation had suffered for centuries under the Russian yoke, but there was no sense of animosity between the two. They were brothers in arms now, bound by a sense of duty to their new nation as well as a common enemy. \u001cDid you take your pill?\u001d\n\nWormhole travel was the only reasonable way to cross the void between stars, but that did not change the fact that it was unspeakably dangerous. The calculations involved with plotting a jump needed to be precise down to the last decimal place, or else a ship could find itself light-years off course. Jumping too close to a star would probably spell disaster for any starship, even with the most precise of calculations. The jump itself was even more harrowing since jumping through an artificial wormhole was like stabbing a hole in the universe and popping out of the other end. They were notoriously unstable, and while the first few test ships mostly made it back to our world, not one returned intact. The universe, apparently, did not like being stabbed.\n\nShips with a crew of hundreds returned unmanned. Sturdy bulkheads and beams became twisted into each other, melding in ways unexplainable by science. Even the most hardened of computer banks returned from an unprotected jump completely wiped. Were it not for the deficient minds of the Coalition\u0019s species, a wormhole jump gone wrong would\u0019ve been the subject of many a horror movie. Only after the Krell Empire developed the Aegis Project, and later the Aegis fields, did wormhole travel become safe.\n\nEven still, troopships\u0019 Aegis fields were just strong enough to keep them from returning as a lump of misshapen scrap that had obviously clashed violently with the laws of physics. Wormhole travel can affect a ship even with the strongest of Aegis fields protecting it, and while this effect is unnoticeable, withdrawal from it is usually harmful to an organism\u0019s psyche. Within a decade, pills were developed to ease this effect into something manageable.\n\nCadet Kaydanovsky did not take his pill. He hurled. A strained \u001cWhat do you think?\u001d came out of his mouth immediately after his lunch.\n\n\u001cI\u0019ll& uh& I\u0019ll call the janitor.\u001d\n\nKaydanovsky left shortly afterward, seeing the wisdom in not being at the scene of his crime. He joined the rest of his ragtag platoon in assembling in the main cargo hold. Rank after rank of soldiers, all hailing from somewhere in Eastern Europe, held formation in a dull, utilitarian room stretching three kilometers. It was nearly the whole length of the ship.\n\nRDF drill instructors paced catwalks above the cadets, scrutinizing them intensely for any flaws. Like birds of prey, they stood poised to swoop on anyone who showed weakness. \u001cFall in, you sack of shit!\u001d Kaydanovsky had heard that before. \u001cMove, or I\u0019ll shove this baton up your monkey ass!\u001d That was a new one, though. It was a tradition in the Republic for those charged with disciplining their fellow soldiers, such as military police or drill instructors, to carry batons while on duty. This harkened back centuries to when the batons were originally used for corporal punishment. While MPs and RDF:Order enforcers carried very real and very powerful stun batons, however, the one worn by the sergeant above Kaydanovsky was purely ceremonial.\n\nThe Russian cadet couldn\u0019t have known that, so the threat implied by waving said baton in the air seemed very real. He fell in line with the rest of his platoon, and the squawking was redirected at some other hapless soul. Kaydanovsky, like all his comrades and a rapidly increasing amount of Earth\u0019s citizens, had undergone surgery to get a translation chip installed in his brain. There was technically a language called Galactic Standard, but it was purely in writing and only used by snobbish diplomats. Translators could handle text just as well, so nobody else felt the need to bother using it. The inventors of said language were too dead to care.\n\n\u001cAll cadets, attention!\u001d That announcement didn\u0019t come from any of the roving drill instructors, instead booming from a series of compact loudspeakers around the cavernous cargo hold. \u001cCaptain on deck!\u001d\n\nKaydanovsky and his comrades snapped to attention. In the oversight deck overlooking the cargo hold, the captain of the troopship straightened out her feathers and began to speak. \u001cAttention, cadets! I am Captain Verilek. You will address me and every other member of the Republic Defense Force as \u0018sir\u0019 until you have earned the right to say otherwise. Let me make this clear, cadets, you are no longer civilians. Your rights as a soldier are lesser than those of a Republic civilian. Your rights as a cadet are privileges, and they can be revoked. When you are told anything by an officer, you will respond with \u0018Yes, sir\u0019, \u0018No, sir\u0019 or \u0018I don\u0019t know, sir\u0019. Am I clear?\u001d\n\nThe sound of thirty thousand voices screaming \u001cYes, sir!\u001d echoed through the cargo hold. Captain Verilek didn\u0019t hear a peep through the bulletproof glass windows.\n\n\u001cI expected nothing less.\u001d said the captain. \u001cOnce this troopship lands, the doors at the front of the hold will open. You will march in formation until your forwardmost rank has reached the red line at the end of the parade field. Then you will stop, and you will stand at attention until directed otherwise. Not one of you will become a soldier until you start acting like one!\u001d\n\nAll of them were soldiers. Emphasis on were. They were well-suited to fighting since they were still trained soldiers, but they would require days of training before they could use the advanced equipment fielded by RDF:Planetary and the other Coalition militaries. For a grand total of one standard week, which was somehow completely identical to one Earth week, Cadet Kaydanovsky and his fifteen million comrades were going to train under Republic officers until they were skilled enough to serve under those officers in combat.\n\nThe troopship set down smoothly. Proper suspension was, surprisingly, important enough to be included in its design. The door slid open seconds later, and the drill instructors began barking orders. Cadet Kaydanovsky was among the last of the 309th Terran Expeditionary Infantry to march, standing straight and at attention, onto the soil of an alien world.\n\nIerad cities were a beautiful sight to see, with even the dullest of their buildings being curved and elegant and the most beautiful ones making even a king\u0019s palace look like an impoverished slum in comparison. Engineering and architecture were common pursuits for those blessed with a creative mind, second only to the military, and the result of that could be seen in Republic design doctrine. Public transportation was commonplace, removing the need for cars, and so all the space that would have been taken by streets and intersections was instead used to build beautiful parks, playgrounds, and monuments to some of the Republic\u0019s heroes. The capital of Iera Prime, uninventively named Epicenter, was a work of art bigger than New York. Even the behemoth climate control plants that dotted every Coalition world, keeping them carbon-neutral, were painted green and white to blend in seamlessly with the environment around them. The few Ierads who could imagine such beauty were smart enough to record how to achieve it, thus immortalizing their legacy and ensuring the Republic's dominance in the art world for centuries to come.\n\nUnfortunately, Cadet Kaydanovsky was not marching through Epicenter or any Ierad city. He was in what was once the garrison base of the 91st Rapid Response Mechanized Unit, but it had been repurposed as a training ground when the 91st was deployed to the conflict on the colony world of Atreides. Ierad military bases, as well as the fortifications surrounding their cities, were starkly utilitarian. There was still a certain beauty in the way they were arranged, how their armor sloped and curved fluidly, and how their cannons merged seamlessly with the structures supporting them, but the RDF prioritized function over form and not the other way around.\n\nAs it was, the parade field of Sector Defense Firebase 91 was nothing special. Cadet Kaydanovsky and his comrades marched on plain white tarmac, designed to reflect heat and keep soldiers\u0019 feet from burning. The human troops were clad in plain grey, the standard uniform of RDF cadets. They would earn their black uniforms when they became true soldiers. \u001cPlatoon, halt!\u001d Kaydanovsky and his unit stopped as one. \u001cRight face!\u001d They executed a picture-perfect turn to face another platoon that was marching away from them. Kaydanovsky\u0019s unit followed.\n\nSoon enough, they were lined up in formation in front of an Ierad lieutenant in full RDF black. He paced back and forth, inspecting his men. A pistol hung at his side, but no baton was visible. \u001cI am Wing Lieutenant Kryll Naxol, your new commander.\u001d he snapped. His feathers were jet-black, blending well with his military uniform. He wore many medals on his chest, each one a gleaming sign of his valor under fire. \u001cI will make an exception for this platoon and this platoon only to address me as Wing Lieutenant Naxol, or simply Lieutenant Naxol or Wing Lieutenant. This is because I am not only your commander but your comrade. You will all serve alongside me on the front lines, and if what I am told is true, you will be the finest soldiers in the Republic. Cadet&\u001d Lieutenant Naxol read Kaydanovsky\u0019s name tag. \u001cKaydanovsky. That\u0019s Chinese, if I remember correctly.\u001d It was Russian, and Naxol knew that. He was testing the cadet, gauging whether or not he would correct a superior officer. That was all part of the standard training doctrine.\n\nKaydanovsky fidgeted awkwardly, not wishing to incur Naxol\u0019s wrath by correcting him. He failed the test. \u001cAnswer honestly and quickly, or not at all.\u001d Lieutenant Naxol advised him.\n\n\u001cNo, sir. It\u0019s Russian, sir.\u001d\n\n\u001cUnderstood.\u001d said the lieutenant. \u001cStep forward!\u001d Kaydanovsky did step forward, and he saluted Lieutenant Naxol. \u001cI did not tell you to salute me, cadet!\u001d snapped the officer. \u001cDrop and give me forty!\u001d Forty ships made up an RDF:Space strike group. Forty soldiers made up an RDF:Planetary platoon. Ierads had a strange fascination with the number forty.\n\nKaydanovsky dropped to the ground and began hammering out pushups, and Lieutenant Naxol addressed the entire platoon. \u001cI may be your comrade in arms, but I am also your commander. I am in charge of whipping you into fighting shape so you may have the honor of giving your lives for the Republic!\u001d He looked down at Cadet Kaydanovsky, pointing his right eye at the huge Russian man. Ierads were like chameleons in that their eyes could move independently of each other. \u001cCadet Kaydanovsky, are you paying attention?\u001d\n\n\u001cYes, Wing Lieutenant!\u001d\n\n\u001cExcellent. I would hate to give you another forty.\u001d The lieutenant looked back at the thirty-nine soldiers in front of him. \u001cI am no coward, nor am I a sloth.\u001d The word Naxol used referred to an Ieran animal that could gather nutrients via crude photosynthesis and had no natural predators, so it gained a reputation as lazy since it rarely ate or moved. That word was unpronounceable by anyone except Ierads, so it was translated to mean sloth. \u001cI will train alongside you, and I will set an example for you to follow. Should I fail in this, it is your duty to set me straight. I will do likewise for you.\u001d Lieutenant Naxol pointed a single claw at Kaydanovsky, who was already halfway done with his punishment. \u001cI am in charge of this platoon, and so I am responsible for its failures. Should a single cadet or a small group step out of line, they will be disciplined individually. However, if this platoon as a unit fails, I will share in its punishment. Don\u0019t mess up.\u001d\n\nThat last sentence got a snicker out of one cadet, and Naxol made sure he regretted it. \u001cStep forward and give me forty, cadet!\u001d The cadet, seeing no other options, hurried to obey Naxol\u0019s order. \u001cIf you think training is funny, you\u0019ll be laughing your beak off when you are deployed to combat. Unfortunately for all of us, it is not! You are here to fight against fascism, just like your grandfathers and grandmothers did in the Great Patriotic War, and I expect you to honor their memories enough to not want to disappoint them.\u001d\n\nNaxol was briefed on Russia\u0019s military history before he was assigned to this unit. He knew enough about his new underlings to fit in and establish a brotherly camaraderie, but not much else.\n\n\u001cAll of you, arrange yourselves into squads of ten.\u001d said the lieutenant. \u001cReport to the rifle range within five standard minutes, in full formation and military dress, or it\u0019s another forty for all of us. Dismissed!\u001d\n\nWith that, Lieutenant Naxol walked off to the rifle range. It was six minutes\u0019 walk away. Forty push-ups, an exercise that the RDF had blatantly stolen from human militaries, were in his future. Boot camp had just begun.\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/175pe7x/earth_is_a_lost_colony_1/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/175ty9h/earth_is_a_lost_colony_3/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/17d86zj/earth_is_a_lost_colony_5/)","subreddit":"HFY","comments":14,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/177vgno/earth_is_a_lost_colony_4/","_row":"Earth is a Lost Colony (4)"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-30","timestamp":1696048382,"title":"What I did not like about Istanbul","text":"There are many things I loved about the city but several I did not like and I think it is worth mentioning for when it\u0019s time to choose the next tourist destination. \n\n- It is very crowded, with both locals and tourists, and many times it feels hectic, much more like a Middle Eastern city than a European one. People push into each other in public crowded spaces and there is no notion of personal space.  I watched the taxi drivers changing lanes all the time impatiently, breaking and accelerating all the time. Public transportation is also crowded and feels unpleasant. Shuttle vans, other than the crazy driving, use the AC intermittently despite the heat of the summer. \n\n- As a tourist, you can expect people will want to scam you somewhere. Not always, there are many great people, but often you would find sellers who want to take advantage of you. There is this opinion that things are not great economically in Turkey, foreigners have money, so it is fair to make foreigners pay more to compensate for the economic problems of the country. \n\n- People smoke everywhere. There is a terrible disrespect for the others if they are non smokers. Kids, pregnant women, it does not matter if they are exposed. \n\n- There are many good restaurants (we loved a little one next to the AirBNB with great food and a friendly owner), but in the touristy areas food is bad and expensive. Many restaurants are dirty - just take a look at the kitchen and bathroom and expect the same in the way food was prepared. \n\n- There is a fascinating ignorance towards the Byzantine history of the city. As a reminder, Constantinople was conquered in 1453, after 1123 years of history as one of the greatest cities in the world. It was the capital of the Roman Empire longer than Rome. History before 1453 is briefly presented and people want to make it look like Istanbul is the creation of the Ottoman Empire. It was sad to see workers digging around the Milion Stone, one of the most important sites in the history of the world, without any concern about destroying the archeological evidence around it. It was sad to see the last orthodox icon inside Hagia Sofia covered. The history of Byzantine Empire is only interesting to people when it can be monetized. \n\n- And lastly, the airport is poorly organized and Turkish Airlines staff while not rude, has no intention of smiling or making you feel they care about the customers.","subreddit":"istanbul","comments":210,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/istanbul/comments/16vxjea/what_i_did_not_like_about_istanbul/","_row":"What I did not like about Istanbul"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-13","timestamp":1697191212,"title":"Just One Drop - Ch 107","text":"Just One Drop \n\nCh 107 - You Simply Must Stay\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBherdin D\u0019saari was practically vibrating as Tom scanned the foot traffic leaving Exit Terminal 378. Races of all sorts dotted the mostly Shil\u0019vati crowd, and Bherdin was craning his neck as best he could to spot his family. \n\nFunnily enough, it was Tom who spotted them first.\n\nMaybe it was the knot of Humans in the group, though it was probably his friend\u0019s extra height. He followed Tom\u0019s gaze when his friend nodded up the causeway. \u001cIs that them?\u001d\n\nIt took a moment for a knot of Tauri to amble out of the way, before he saw them, and his heart fluttered in his chest. \u001cOh! Oh my, yes!\u001d The flutter settled, bathed in a warm glow of satisfaction.\n\nThry\u0019sis had put on weight!\n\nThe poor dear still looked much herself, and was shepherding her kho-wives, poor Brelak, and a host of others along in her wake. Her business suit was a bit bedraggled, doubtless from all the strain. \n\nBherdin felt his spirits rise, and he waved delicately as he stepped out to catch their eye. Akitai glanced his way, said something to Miara, and moments later they began heading in his direction.\n\nThankfully Tom had the connections to get a sizable transport. Melondi was over with Vedeem, and his son watched uncertainly. They had poor Celani to consider, but there were plenty of women to manage. Not that Thry\u0019sis *ever* minded *organizing.* The stars would go out before-\n\n\u001cOh, you poor dears! Welcome home!\u001d Bherdin reached out to embrace Brelak fondly, before stepping back. There was a small throng of children gathered about, and he gave them all a welcoming smile as he took inventory. Tom was exchanging nods with the eldest Human male in Thry\u0019sis\u0019 group, but there simply wasn\u0019t time to watch how they greeted one another in the wild& Trik\u0019sis and Solanna had *certainly* grown, and Rhe\u0019alla hovered protectively close to a Human man and woman, each of whom held a small child in their arms. That made the young man near her Jacarin, and he\u0019d grown up into a fine& \n\n*\u0018Oh dear& Well, there's no accounting for taste out in the colonies. Shopping later!\u0019*\n\nThere was *always* time for shopping, and with luck he *might* get Tom to come. Clothing aside, they all looked quite well, and he braced himself as Thry\u0019sis made her way over, allowing himself to be briefly embraced. \n\n\u001cCousin! It\u0019s *so* good to be home!\u001d Thry\u0019sis stood back and looked him over briefly, before taking in the group. \u001cAnd this must be Vedeem!\u001d\n\n\u001cIntroductions later! You all must be perfectly exhausted, and we simply *must* get you home.\u001d Bherdin straightened his jacket. It was taffeta, after all, though Brelak looked tired and wouldn't judge. Still, when one was out in public, the public eye& \u001cWe\u0019ve substantial transportation arranged, with Ms Ton\u0019is here to help drive us home.\u001d\n\n\u001cOf course& and it's good to see you employing the disabled!\u001d Thry\u0019sis stepped over to give Celani an approving nod. \u001cIt\u0019s a pleasure to meet you. It's such a relief to see a woman looking after my cousin. Men of his age need someone about& and are you a veteran, too? That\u0019s *exactly* the sort of thing my administration takes care of, back on Earth! I\u0019m sure Miara will have a hundred questions for you, and perhaps *something* can be done to get you a reliable prosthetic.\u001d\n\n*\u0018Of my age? You& turox!\u0019*\n\nAny burgeoning desire to scratch her eyes out was cast aside as Thry\u0019sis turned back. \u001cOh, and you brought a girl to help. That\u0019s thoughtful. The girls and I have been trying to take care of Brelak, but it was such a tiring trip.\u001d\n\nBherdin watched as Thry\u0019sis D\u0019saari, his \u0018beloved\u0019 cousin, and scion of House D\u0019saari, unceremoniously dropped her carry-on bag into Melondi\u0019s arms with barely a glance. \u001cThank you, young lady.\u001d\n\nThere were moments when the universe held its breath. When the Goddess looked down upon the affairs of mortals to intervene.\n\nBherdin watched his son\u0019s eyes go wide as Princess Khelira Tasoo, heiress to the Duchy of Varkeif and the Eastern Palace, opened her mouth& then closed it again, shouldering the bag.\n\nThry\u0019sis was already in her element. \u001cCome on, everyone! The baggage carousel should be just this way!\u001d \n\nEvery so often, the Goddess was kind. The universe let the matter go, and Bherdin remembered to breathe. He closed ranks with Brelak, and the entire throng of his family clan began moving& \n\nHe\u0019d managed at least a dozen steps in his cousin\u0019s wake when the loudspeaker sounded over the terminal.\n\n\u001cGentlemen and ladies, Gentlemen and ladies. Your attention, please. All terminal traffic will shut down in three hours to clear local airspace for priority arrival. The report has just arrived from Space Traffic Control - Home Fleet has returned.\u001d\n\n\u001cTerminal 250 through 400 will be cleared for personnel transfer and resupply. Please conclude your business. Alternate landing for inbound cargo will be posted. Thank you for your cooperation.\u001d\n\nBherdin glimpsed the expression on Melondi\u0019s face&\n\nThe Goddess had a sense of humor, but it wasn\u0019t always kind.\n\n\\_\n\nLevi took a deep breath, adjusted Joshua's weight in his arms, and tried to relax as the family began moving through the massive starport. It wasn\u0019t the size of the crowd that set alarm bells ringing in the back of his head, though he was certainly no fan of crowds. It wasn't even how many of them were staring. That was just a thing Shil'vati did.\n\nNo, most of them were staring at Josh and Cassie. \n\nHe glanced over at the girl nestled in Melody\u0019s arms, just in time to watch a pair of gray-skinned humanoids with horns and glowing lines criss-crossing their exposed skin as they walked past. They stared, wide eyed, at the infant and then turned and began jabbering excitedly in a language he didn't understand, looking back all the while.\n\n*'Easy, dude. Let's bring the paranoia down a notch or two, hmm?'*\n\nThry'sis was in rare form this morning, issuing instructions and treading on proverbial toes with all the blustering self-assuredness she'd had when he'd first met her. Bherdin, the cousin who was here to pick them all up, had looked homicidal for a moment during the conversation between Thry'sis and the rather military-looking woman with one arm. The Human, who'd introduced himself to Zachariah as Tom Warrick, wore a long-suffering expression accented by the occasional wince. Even the girl she'd dumped her bag on seemed utterly flabbergasted before making a quick recovery.\n\n*'Speaking of which&'*\n\n\"Hey bud,\" he addressed the boy in his arms as they approached the baggage carousel. \"I need you to go to Mama Rhe\u0019 for me, okay?\"\n\nJoshua nodded and Levi handed him off to his Shil'vati wife, who immediately began pointing out cool stuff to him. The two were soon engrossed in the holographic advertisements that floated near the room's ceiling.\n\nMentally shifting gears, Levi walked over to where the young lady was holding Thry'sis' bag with a bemused expression. \n\n\"Pardon me.\" He stifled a wince at the thickly accented Vatikre coming out of his mouth but soldiered on. \"I wanted to say sorry for Lady D\u0019saari. She means well, but is& well, she is a noble.\" He held out a hand. \"I can take it, if you like.\"\n\nThe girl blinked in surprise, then waved dismissively. \"No, no, it's fine! I was just surprised. But thank you for the offer, Mr&?\"\n\n\"I am Levi.\u001d He turned and waved a hand at the girls. \u001cThose are my wives, Melody and Rhe'alla. And thank you, your grace?\"\n\nThe girl stumbled. \"W-what?\"\n\n\u001cSorry! Thank you *for* your grace.\u001d Levi gave her an apologetic grimace, \"Sorry, I\u0019m learning still much of the language. Thank you for& um& being graceful? Being kind about the mother of my wife?\"\n\n\"Oh! *Ohhh&* I understand.\" She gave a quiet laugh and a shake of her head. \"My name is Melondi. You said Levi, Rhe\u0019alla, and Melody, right? You said they\u0019re *both* your wives?\"\n\n\"I did.\" He glanced at her out of the corner of his eye. \"I'm afraid that I am looking not for a third kho, if that is what you *really* wanting to know.\"\n\nMelondi gave a polite snort of laughter. \"Does that come up often?\"\n\n\"All the time. I think it is more kindest to say it up front.\"\n\n\"No need to worry about me, Levi,\" she assured him with a smile. \"May I ask about your little ones?\"\n\n\"The bigger one is Joshua, and the discount one is Cassandra.\"\n\n\"How *old* are they? They look& small.\"\n\n\"Four and two. That would be a little over one and two, in Shil'vati years.\"\n\n\"But they're so tiny!\"\n\n\"Shil'vati women are big. They make big babies. Human women are small. They make small babies.\" The rumble of the luggage conveyor drew his attention. Levi shrugged, and gave her a rueful grin. \u001cBut please excusing me, while I grab my bag. Pleased to meeting you!\u001d\n\nThe D\u0019saari women were already pulling the suitcases and bags off as the carousel, as it homed in on the signals from their omni-pads. Levi ignored the looks from other passengers as he slipped through the crowd, snagging the bags of his wives and children. In short order, he had a duffle bag slung over each shoulder, a suitcase in each hand, and was plodding back toward his family.\n\nRhe\u0019alla laughed as he lumbered up. \u001cAll in one trip?\u001d\n\n\u001cAlways!\u001d\n\nMelody nodded back the way he\u0019d come from. \u001cYou made quite an impression for yourself, back there.\u001d\n\nTurning to look over his shoulder, he stifled a groan. There were easily two dozen Shil\u0019vati, a couple of bug-things, and something that looked for all the world like a Naga, all staring at him with wide eyes. They hastily looked away, with expressions ranging from chagrin to blue-faced embarrassment.\n\n\u001cAnd here I was thinking the staff of the star liner were thirsty&\u001d\n\nMelody shrugged. \u001cWell, you *are* something of a rarity, sweetie.\u001d\n\n\u001cWhat do you mean?\u001d\n\n\u001cLook around. There are more men here with us, *in our group*, than I\u0019ve seen since we left Earth.\u001d Melody gave an artful shrug of her shoulders, but it was her bemused smile that told him he\u0019d missed the broad side of the barn. \u001cAnd you should have let us get all the bags.\u001d\n\nLevi rested one of the duffles against an ornate bronze trash bin and turned, scanning the bustling concourse with a growing sense of astonishment. Apart from the species that were utterly unrecognizable to him, he counted a grand total of& three men. Two Shil\u0019vati males, both with a bevy of vigilant women around them, and a Raikiri who looked like he could go toe to toe with the Hulk for at least thirty seconds.\n\nA moment later, the cylinder slid away and rotated, a filmy red eye peering out at him through a slit in the top. Levi leapt back in alarm as it burbled something at him harshly, then turned and trundled toward the exit.\n\n\u001c...we\u0019re definitely not in Kansas anymore.\u001d\n\n\\_\n\nJama sighed as he looked over the reports on Earth. It was disheartening, after so long a road to reach this point, but the partisans springing up around Denver needed to be taught a lesson. He\u0019d seen this behavior before. Left unchecked, resistance fighters would start springing up in the midwestern part of the continent, creating a domino effect throughout the territory. The clear move was to use the marines to ferret them out. It was disappointing, but there were few alternatives.\n\nHe looked at the report again and shrugged. The locals didn\u0019t stand a chance, and crushing the resistance was for the best.\n\nHe looked at the screen and typed in a few notes that he thought would prove useful in quelling the natives later. Ideally, the local population would fall in line, as long as things were handled quickly, and there wouldn\u0019t need to be unrest through North America. It wasn\u0019t as if there were long odds against the marines on station, and it would be better to keep the situation contained and away from the continent at large.\n\n*\u0018Not that partisans ever saw sense. The useless buggers would try and spread, though. There was a home front advantage, and the unrest will rise like the tide, nae mistake about that.\u0019*\n\nHe\u0019d seen it before, and there was no doubt this would be the same. It was a question of keeping things proportional. You let things get out of hand, and sentiment everywhere would shift across the planet.\n\nAt least there was no call for nuclear weapons& not yet, anyway, and he jotted down a terse notation in his omni-pad. Allowing partisans to spread was how these scenarios spiraled out of control, and before you knew it, sentiment changed and relations were ruined. Should that happen, as distasteful as it was, nuclear weapons might be an option. Until then, there was nae call for anything more overt. A simple, decisive decapitation strike would pacify the-\n\nAn alert chime sounded on his omni-pad, and Jama closed his notes and swiped open the alert. Reading through the notice he paused in thought. \n\nHome Fleet was back in the system. Shil was rejoicing, and the Palace had scheduled an announcement for 7 PM, Capitol time.\n\nJama spared a thought for what it all might mean. The Empress would need time to make an announcement, and she was a decent soul. The return of the Home Fleet would bring a close to this sad chapter in everyone's lives. Her Imperial Majesty would honor her daughter with a state funeral, of course, then life would go on.\n\nHer Highness, Princess Khelandri, the once and future Empress, would be sealed into a golden pod and sent to her final rest in Sham\u0019s embrace. One with the sunlight, she would shine down on Shil along with her ancestors, sanctified in the embrace of the star itself&\n\nAnd, of course, the period of mourning would be over. Just as well that Alra\u0019da had reached out to ask him for an appraisal. It offered a perfect excuse to show Tom a proper night out. \n\n*\u0018Trade at the Tide Pool will be brisk, with everyone wanting a knees up!\u0019*\n\nIt was quite a fair trade, as Warrick\u0019s arrival had provided invaluable insights into pre-collapse civilizations. Who would have thought the lad would adapt so readily, though? He was proving to be a handful for young Miv, but she was a sensible lass. After all that had happened, it was remarkable to find Tom was a good friend; now he could return the favor by showing the lad a homeworld that was nae longer in mourning.\n\nAfter setting an alarm to watch the announcement, Jama set his pad down and reopened the other file. \n\nHe studied the report once more, with a dour sense of the tragedy that would surely unfold. So many lives sacrificed, but it would be for the greater good. \n\n*\u0018Still, treason\u0019s treason, nae matter how ye shape it&\u0019*\n\nThat was the thing about revolt that anyone from Sevastutav or Cambria could tell you. There was no excuse. Nothing that would mitigate the dishonor of a vassal rising against the lawful order. There were no mitigating circumstances against rebellion against a sovereign.\n\n*\u0018Unless ye win&\u0019*\n\nJama looked at the information and shook his head. The marines would crush any resistance before it could spread. There would be no revolt in Denver, only a senseless waste of Human life&\n\n\\_\n\n*\u0018...Hold on to sixteen, as long as you can. Changes come around real soon, make us women and men&\u0019*\n\nJohn Cougar Mellencamp\u0019s voice rolled through Tom\u0019s thoughts as the bus made its way through the Capitol, and he considered the crowd around him in the privacy of his thoughts, watching Melondi.\n\nThe city changed around them on their drive toward Miv\u0019eire\u0019s home. The tall megascrapers that had worn muted colors during the time of mourning were lighting up again, vibrant golds and purples and reds streaking up their sides, illuminating the skyline as the news spread.\n\nMelondi was somewhere around nineteen in Earth years, but it wasn\u0019t the years, it was the experience that made a difference. He thought back to the young woman he\u0019d met before he\u0019d ever conceived she might be an Imperial Princess. \n\nMelondi had the bloom of youth about her. Not innocent and experimenting, she was still more polished than people her age usually were. Given her classmates, that was saying something. The girl had a certainty about her that didn\u0019t come easily. A resolution to her character that, truth be told, reminded Tom of everything said about her mother, the Empress.\n\nIn the beginning, he\u0019d been a little in awe of his new circumstances and trying to adjust, but his class had made an impression. The girls were special, every one of them, but thankfully \u0018Human Studies\u0019 had been a group of twelve. Rather than the huge auditorium that was \u0018Marriage Fundamentals\u0019, he\u0019d come to know his students as people.\n\nThere was plenty of give and take to Melondi. She stood by her friends, seemed to love Vedeem without reservation for his station, and pursued life with a vigor undaunted by the weight on her shoulders. Tom studied her as she whispered something to Vedeem, and wondered what she was feeling now.\n\nIt was easier to ponder her feelings than to explore his own.\n\nHow many Humans had he seen since he\u0019d been on Shil? Three, and never together. In fairness, he hadn\u0019t been all that social before leaving Earth, but this was different. Now, for the first time in months, there were *eight*, all experiencing Shil for the first time.\n\nThe two infants didn\u0019t count. The young ones, Cassandra and Joshua, were holding on to their parents with all the certainty in the world that whatever was strange, that Mom and Dad& and Mom& would make it safe. He\u0019d known from Bherdin that Levi McClendon was married to his cousin\u0019s kho-daughter. That was part of how Human Food had gotten started, though Bherdin sometimes got sketchy on the details. It was nice to see the reality, though. Levi and his wives& and the way Joshua was hanging on to& Rhe-something. Rhe\u0019ella?\n\n*\u0018One more thing to remember, besides not saying \u0018Mel\u0019 when those two are in the same room.\u0019*\n\nMelody and Melondi. Humans and Shil\u0019vati&\n\nLevi\u0019s younger brother, Eli, looked out the window now and then while talking to his sister& Hannah& and tried not to look too impressed. Hannah didn\u0019t share his reservations. Sitting in the row behind Melondi, she\u0019d been asked questions as they drove through the city and seemed to be having a good time. Despite everything that must be on her mind, Melondi had answered every question thoughtfully, at least when Hannah\u0019s& brother\u0019s wife\u0019s kho-mother& wasn\u0019t taking over the conversation. Thry\u0019sis looked like she was in her element, and enjoying every minute of it. \n\nNot that Tom could blame her. \n\nThe D\u0019saari clan seemed to be made up of its Matriarch, Thry\u0019sis, along with her kho-wives, Akita, Nyxie, and& Miara. The three of them were watching over their husband, Brelak, who was deep in a quiet, yet animated, conversation with Bherdin. As for Thry\u0019sis, she seemed to thrive on doing something all the time, and watching her supervise the bus had been interesting&\n\nThankfully, Ce\u0019lani seemed to be getting on with Miara and weathered it all with good grace.\n\nRhe\u0019alla& that was it& was sitting with Levi, while the other D\u0019saari\u0019s looked outside as the vast spaceport fell away and the Capital slowly surrounded them. Solanna and Trik\u0019sis were looking outside with an easy manner, while the youngest girl, Yumi, sighed and watched over their younger brother, a boy named Lar\u0019gos.\n\nThe kicker was the older boy, Jacarin. He was around Vedeem\u0019s age&\n\n*\u0018Hell of a thing seeing a Shil\u0019vati guy wearing a flannel shirt and faded blue jeans like a second skin. I thought Bherdin was going to faint.\u0019*\n\nAs for the oldest McClendons, it was hard to tell. He\u0019d traded a few cautious words with Zachariah and his wife, who\u0019d told him to call her Jenn moments before Thry\u0019sis began herding them all out of the terminal.\n\nDespite feeling hustled, he actually felt some envy toward the Shil\u0019vati matriarch.\n\n*\u0018I tried to wrap up Earth like a present for Miv. How would I feel, taking her back, along with Lea, Ce\u0019lani, Desi, Lea\u0019s mothers, and maybe half my class? Jax would be glued to the window, and Lark would be taking pictures of everything. Desi would be filing everything away she saw to ask me later, while Dihsala would be trying to play it cool. Lea\u0019s mothers would probably be asking me about nude beaches& I can\u0019t exactly blame the woman for being proud and wanting to share it all. The youngest have probably never left Earth.\u0019*\n\nMind you, it\u0019d been hard not to laugh when they\u0019d driven through the government center&\n\n\u001cJust think, children! The Empress is back!\u001d Thry\u0019sis exclaimed as they passed the Assembly of Noble Houses. \u001cWe *may* even see an appearance by one of the Royal Family!\u001d\n\nTom bit his lip and watched Melondi, whose smile became a bit glazed. He could laugh himself sick later on. Besides, they\u0019d arrived&\n\nPrelitauri was a nice district. Off in its commercial area, Human Food was one of many upmarket, quirky shops that catered to clients from all over the quarter. Huddled along the coast, it was one of those towns that was wealthy without being rich. Affluent, yes, but it was a \u0018Petoskey\u0019, rather than a \u0018Cape Cod\u0019. Picturesque, the houses dotting the coast were lovely without being the super mansions of the Shil\u0019vati elite, and despite all the difficulties to what was left of House Pel\u0019avon, Miv\u0019s home with Sholea had been the one thing she\u0019d fought to hold on to. Now, after inheriting a substantial sum, the cottage was back to its full glory&\n\n\u001cWhy, Bherdin, this is just lovely!\u001d Thry\u0019sis exclaimed. \u001cBut, I\u0019d thought we were dropping off the children first?\u001d\n\n\u001cWe *are*, dear. Mister Warrick and his wives have been kind enough to lend us his home for the duration of your stay.\u001d Two seats ahead, Bherdin didn\u0019t quite inflate, but he still looked pleased in profile. \u001cThat way dear Brelak will have a room to himself, with one set aside for the McClendon\u0019s, one for Nixie and Miara, and another for you and Akitai.\u001d\n\n\u001cHis *fiancee*, Miss Ce\u0019lani, is staying with them for her recovery,\u001d he added a bit tartly.\n\nTom watched the woman flounder for a moment, but she recovered a lot faster than he\u0019d expected. Ce\u0019lani managed to look more flustered at being called his fiancee than being labeled a \u0018disabled veteran\u0019, but for all her bluster, her thanks seemed genuine& Not that she wasn\u0019t off and supervising the kids unloading the bags moments later.\n\nZachariah caught Tom's eye with a look, and arched a questioning eyebrow, while his wife gave him a warm but thoughtful smile. Tom smiled back at the pair of them, and gave a little \u0018it\u0019s all fine\u0019 shrug of his shoulders& and it was, as long as the kids didn\u0019t destroy the place. As his source for coffee and ham, he owed them much.\n\n\u001cHot damn, a place on the beach?\u001d Eli mussed Hannah\u0019s hair on his way to the door, forgetting to look bored for a moment. \u001cThis is gonna be great!\u001d\n\nLevi, the older brother, was up and gave Tom a quiet nod. At his side, Melody wore a demure smile, while Rhe\u0019alla was beaming, the trio busy organizing their children, in the way parents always were. It wouldn't do to barge in, but Miv might want to meet them& She\u0019d always wanted children in the house.\n\n*\u0018No, this will be alright.\u0019*\n\n\u001cWell, I can hardly wait to see where *we\u0019re* staying, cousin. Akita and I will be& wonderful bunkmates,\u001d Thry\u0019sis offered crisply. \u001cI\u0019m sure it will be so wonderfully& cozy.\u001d\n\nTom watched as Bherdin turned to the window with a dismissive \u001cFttt!\u001d\n\n*\u0018God damn. I* swear *I can see his blood pressure rising from here.\u0019*\n\n\\_\n\nThe only public compartment on the ship with real space was the gym. Liam stretched out fully, under the watchful gaze of Belda and Pris.\n\nIt had taken some coaxing to get the story out of Pris about what had put her into such a funk, but when she\u0019d told them both& Well, he\u0019d never *really* seen Bel pissed off before, and truth be told he was a little irate himself. But Bel? She\u0019d spent a good twenty minutes using language he\u0019d never heard from her.\n\nSome of it wasn\u0019t even in Vatikre, but Liam was pretty sure he got the gist, just fine.\n\nGetting them all out of the stateroom had been a good idea. It had been two days together, and he needed the room.\n\nA trip off Shil with his& well, Bel was his girl, and he wanted to marry her, but two days into the trip, and she already wanted him to have a *girlfriend*? What the hell would he tell Hope when he got back?\n\nThat was the neat thing about Shil\u0019vati women; they didn\u0019t fool around. Pris and Bel were friends from pretty different worlds, but they both wore their hearts on their sleeves. Pris had more filters than Bel& after listening to her cuss for fifteen minutes, he was pretty sure she had a *lot* more& but that was nice, too. \n\nYou knew *exactly* where you stood.\n\nGrowing up on Earth with Tyler, there hadn\u0019t been a lot of that. Not that he hadn\u0019t understood. Maybe not at first, but eventually he\u0019d caught on. Hope hadn\u0019t had any more choice about leaving than he\u0019d had about staying. Not that it made staying with Tyler any easier. He\u0019d always been stuck in the past, worrying on one hand or judging him on the other. He\u0019d done the best he\u0019d known how, but it hadn\u0019t been easy for either of them.\n\nTyler had gone ballistic at his choice to go live with Hope, and things had gotten ugly, fast. In the end, he hadn\u0019t been able to get out of there fast enough.\n\nIt was easy to feel comfortable with Bel& and as it turned out, it was just as easy to be around Pris. He didn't find himself worrying about them saying one thing and thinking something else& It was kind of like dealing with a Marine back home, but in a *nice* way. Sure, you knew what was on their mind, and maybe it was because he\u0019d settled so easily into the boyfriend zone with Bel, but Pris wasn\u0019t making it weird. She was expectant, sure, but it was like they were a pod of two. He didn\u0019t feel like he was being fought over& or judged.\n\nThat was pretty chill.\n\nComing to Shil had been a real change. He\u0019d steered clear of Hope's students, but everywhere he\u0019d run into Shil\u0019vati or the Rakiri at the club, they\u0019d been no worse than people back home. Okay, the fight in the bar had been less than great, but again& not so bad. Belda had his back, and not just a little bit. She was there - all in, all the way.\n\nAnd Pris? Well, Pris gave him the same vibe.\n\nHe looked at the pair as they chatted together, watching him while he limbered up.\n\n*\u0018And yeah, it\u0019s confusing, but face it, they\u0019d never abandon you.\u0019*\n\nAnd if they *were* confusing, it wasn\u0019t because they were messing with your head. It was just easy to be with people who didn't always have their guard up.\n\nIt had taken him a lot of growing up to get past Tyler, mostly thanks to his friends. They\u0019d always been pretty easy& and Tyler really hadn\u0019t. It seemed like the older generation always felt the need to protect themselves. It was like that for a lot of people after the Shil\u0019vati came& but always keeping your guard up wasn't any way to live. It was kind of why he\u0019d never been comfortable with Human girls. There always seemed to be some hidden agenda.\n\nMaybe Tyler was right about *some* of it, but he always took things way too far. There was a point when you went from being careful to being so hurt that you stopped letting anyone in. That wasn\u0019t what he wanted. \n\nTyler had always tried to be in control. It was all a lie, and he\u0019d been a miserable bastard whenever he ran into something he couldn\u0019t. The older Liam had gotten, the more that \u0018something\u0019 had been him.\n\nBel and Pris weren't afraid of being open& of being vulnerable. Sure, Pris had literally tried to hide herself away, but she\u0019d opened up just as fast when they talked.\n\n*\u0018Bel was probably right to push me out of the cabin to find her, too.\u0019*\n\nIn their own ways, both of them showed they liked him& and neither of them had been afraid to ask for help. They\u0019d shown they trusted him. Bel had already clearly invested herself in him& and once he\u0019d said yes, she\u0019d doubled down. He didn't feel strangled, it was just like there was no bullshit about it& and it felt like Pris wanted the same thing.\n\nPris was a lot more exuberant than Bel& or at least blushed less. She didn't have any social anxiety. After his talk with her, it was pretty clear she really didn\u0019t care what other people thought.\n\nShe\u0019d cared a lot about what *he* thought.\n\nThat was pretty chill, too.\n\nThe more he saw of her, the more he saw why she and Bel were such good friends. Show some people a door and they\u0019d wonder if you were going to shut it in their faces. Bel walked right through& but she also held it open for Pris.\n\nAnyway, it had gotten him out of their stateroom. With nothing much to do besides watch videos, he\u0019d badly wanted the exercise& and it turned out Pris didn\u0019t know how to dance.\n\nWell, *that* wouldn\u0019t fly, but instead of the battle he expected in offering to teach her, she\u0019d jumped at the chance. Of course, his kind of dancing needed room, and there was the gym&\n\nHe almost finished stretching when a whistle came from the corridor. \n\nIt was Halra, the crew woman that had been giving Pris such a load of shit.\n\n\u001cLooking good, there.\u001d Halca was leaning in the doorway and licked her tongue across her lips suggestively. \u001cGot room for one more, handsome?\u001d\n\n\u001cNo, I really don't.\u001d The words were on his lips, and he\u0019d meant to say them.\n\nIt was just that Belda got there first.\n\n\u001cListen up, tits for brains, you can get your miserable, skanky ass out of here and shove it back in the tail end of this barge with the rest of the crap!\u001d Bel growled as she crossed the room, raising her fist. \u001cYou even *think* about laying a hand on Liam and I swear to the Goddess that-\u001d\n\n\u001cBel& You\u0019re a lady.\u001d Pris pursed her lips and sighed, laying a hand on Bel\u0019s fist. \u001cRemember your ABCs? Always be clear& Always be classy& Always be concise.\u001d\n\n\u001cBut she-\u001d\n\n\u001cI mean it& The ABCs are for everyone. Clear, classy, and concise.\u001d Pris looked from Bel to the engineer and her voice became colder than space. \u001cFuck off, bitch.\u001d  \n\n\\_\n\nTom Steinberg sat in his man cave working on a pet project of his. Well, everyone called it the office, but it was a man cave, damnit! The work wasn't anything particularly malicious, just some blackmail, should he run across members of the Nobility he particularly disliked. In this case, though, it was a little more close to home\n\nThere were a couple lunatics he paid to go *obtain* information from sources, and currently he was looking in on the head of the Shil equivalent of the Home Owners Association of Prelitauri, of which his neighborhood was one part. It wasn't Tom\u0019s business to ask whether the lunatics hung the HOA's people over the side of buildings or tickled them with a feather till they promised to behave, but HOA\u0019s just pissed him off.\n\nAfter the last few times they\u0019d charged him for *really* stupid shit, he\u0019d decided it was war. \n\nOftentimes, just gathering information to gather more information required blackmail all its own.\n\nAnd thus, Tom was currently watching some footage of the HOA President& specifically what she'd done with a hooker he'd hired just for this purpose. Mind you, she\u0019d paid for the hooker with appropriated HOA funds. \n\nShe deserved what she got.\n\nAnd as for what she'd done to earn his ire& well, she hadn't exactly badmouthed survivors of the *Liberation*, or legislated in favor of male trafficking, but& well& she just had the most punchable face on the HOA, and Tom intensely disliked her. When you were a spy, you were allowed to do that. Playing politics was a fun hobby! Lucrative, too.\n\nAnyways, Tom sipped his bloodwine - not the Pesrin stuff, that would melt your insides - chuckling at the lewd display in front of him. \"Got you,\" he grumbled, watching the depravity at the villa on Palm Miandoir& \n\n\"Tom?\" If Tom's desk hadn't been facing the door, he would have been in deep shit and having to explain that, no, he wasn't watching porn, this was work stuff.\n\n\"Yeah, what's up?\" There stood Avee, radiant as ever, especially with the baby on the way. Behind her was& a Pesrin? \"Can I help you?\" he asked. Tom wasn't averse to Pesrin; his experiences generally left him quite fond of them. Still, one of the furry nopes standing in your office was *never* a good sign.\n\n\"Hi!\" the girl said brightly. \"I'm Rhykishi, of the Natahss'ja! Remember me!?\"\n\n\"Ummm& yah. Rhykishi of the Natahss'ja. Sure,\u001d Tom answered wearily. She still hadn't explained what she was doing here. \"Did you need something?\" he added.\n\n\"She just knocked on the door,\" Avee confessed. \n\nOk, that was odd. If a Pesrin wanted something they didn't usually bother with politeness. As a species, the Pesrin were more \u0018kick the door down and take it\u0019 types.\n\n\"Yeah! We met the other night. You drove my sister home.\" Without a word, Rhykishi slid behind Tom's desk and peered at his work. She must've pegged what he was doing, because she gave him a quick \"nice\" before hopping down into the other chair. \"So, you know she needs to get her shit together?\"\n\n\"A quick kick in the thorps?\" Something was moving under Tom's desk. It was Shanky, so Tom picked up the rhinel and held him on his lap, absentmindedly tapping out a tune on his head.\n\n\"Well&\" Rhykishi looked concerned. \"We've done all the kicking we can& It didn't work, so we figured she needs a Hahackt instead.\"\n\nTom's Pesrin was still spotty in parts, so he gave it his best guess. \"A mentor?\"\n\n\"Uh huh!\" Rhykishi nodded brightly, swinging her feet beneath her. \"She\u0019s a great scout, but she needs someone to teach her how to get her shit together.\"\n\n\"Great! Want me to find you one? I can put the word out.\"\n\n\"No no!\" Rhykishi put a hand up. \"We selected *you!*\"\n\n\"Oh& I see&\" Tom's mind raced. His life had just gotten a lot more complicated. But he knew Pesrin. He didn't really have a way to say no. He sat there, staring into space as Shanky nibbled on his fingers. \"That's& a helluva honor& Um, let me talk to my wife!\"\n\n\"Sure thing!\u001d Rhykishi hopped up, swinging her asiak in an amused way as she looked around the room. \u001cBy the way, you gonna eat that Rhinel?\"\n\n\"Yah!\" Shanky yelled indignantly. While the Rhinel held Tom\u0019s attention, the vid he\u0019d been watching was overridden by a news alert. Tom took a quick look at the bulletin and nearly had a heart attack. \n\nThe Home Fleet was returning. His mind swam with new work opportunities. Horny sailors always had some skeletons in the closet, especially officers&\n\n\u0018The Palace is pleased to announce word from Space Traffic Control, heralding the return of significant elements of Home Fleet. Our beloved Empress is committed to preserving our sovereignty, and remains away on deployment along the Alliance Border. For now, Princess Kamaud\u0019re and her son, Prince Lu\u0019ral, have returned in her stead, bringing her best wishes for a bountiful Eth\u0019rovi. \n\nThis momentous occasion marks a significant event in our Imperium\u0019s history. The return of Home Fleet symbolizes her dedication to safeguarding our interests and maintaining peace and security. \n\nIn the Empress\u0019 absence, a grand reception and ceremonial events are planned to welcome the Princess Kamaud\u0019re home; comprehensive information can be found on the data-link attached. We encourage all citizens to join in celebrating this moment of national pride and unity. \n\n\u0018Even as we do, the Palace also asks that Prince Lu\u0019ral and his wife be granted the peace and isolation they need, in their time of grief.\n\n\u0018During this celebration, let us come together-\u0019 \n\n_\n\n\u0018...as one Empire, demonstrating our unwavering support. Our thoughts go out to Her Imperial Majesty as she carries out her-\u0019\n\nJama switched off the announcement and scowled at the monitor. There was never anything worth watching on the thing that was nae outdone by a good novel, but the news was the news, and he flipped through the information on the data-link. \n\nAnd what news that was.\n\nOnly half of Home Fleet was back in the system. Half. Certainly, it was a relief to countless families during the holiday, as husbands and sons welcomed back their loved ones& but the other half was being deployed by the Empress\u0019 hand, and would nae be home any time soon. Oh, aye, the Empress returned her daughter and son, along with a fair bit of the court, to help celebrate Eth\u0019rovi. The time of mourning was past& but what time were they entering now?\n\nJama pursed his lips as he pondered the report, reading between the lines.\n\nThe Empress had found her daughter's remains - at least what would serve for symbolic burial - and that would happen when she returned& but that time was not now. Her Majesty had set the fleet on the grim task of scouring the area of debris spread across the system, to leave no daughter behind, and the fleet had brought them home. Her Majesty would nae return home with her child, leaving others to mourn empty-handed. \n\nIt was nae her style.\n\nAnd having done that? If you cut through all the conciliatory turox shit, Kamilesh was deploying Home Fleet along the Alliance border to wipe every pirate, privateer, and \u0018unregistered military asset\u0019 out of her sky. The woman\u0019s blood up, and by the goddess, she\u0019d make the stars bleed.\n\nThat was *very much* her style.\n\nSending back the Court had been a kind gesture, though it would have consequences. Princess Kamaud\u0019re was back. The useless tit was probably planning a party, and while tha\u0019 had its time and place during Eth\u0019rovi, the lass\u0019s habits had little to do with affairs of state. Kamaud\u0019re wanted to be loved or at least a measure of public adoration, but the sad truth was there was little about her that was lovable. She observed the proper forms duty required, but there was a streak of narcissism about her that showed around the edges. An indolence that seemed to put \u0018self\u0019 beside \u0018service\u0019, and possibly before it.\n\nAs for Prince Lu\u0019ral? He\u0019d always been comfortable providing his mother support, but he\u0019d removed himself from the spotlight of public life to raise a family. Only the death of his sister had taken him from them, and he\u0019d returned to the worst news any father could imagine. There would be no Eth\u0019rovi for the lad. No welcome home from Lady Orelea. No loving embrace from his youngest daughter. Lu\u0019ral would only have learned of their deaths when the fleet returned, and surely all of Shil would weep with him.\n\nLove and loss. Triumph and tragedy. Redemption& and revenge. It would be a bittersweet Eth\u0019rovi& and Jama wondered what it all might mean for Princess Khelira. The lass was probably wandering the halls of the Palace. Not yet out in the public, she\u0019d be trapped by custom and circumstance& though Ganya probably knew more. He\u0019d wager the lass was studying at the Academy, though with the holiday break, she\u0019d be alone. \n\nAh well, so much for the news. It was nae his affair.\n\nJama re-opened his game of Civilization 7 and reviewed his forces. His Spanish had marched up from South America, re-taken Mexico, and demolished the American menace. Marines had crushed the partisans around Denver and secured his final hold on the continent. The war had nae been popular with the other AI forces, but with the American AI subdued, the only real contender left was the Chinese& \n\nSoon, he\u0019d rule all of Earth with a military victory& though a cultural win was always preferable.\n\nIt really was ironic. For all that Tom insisted that Humans wanted peace, they had an innate talent for war. Even this game he\u0019d borrowed from Tom was proof enough. Humans dreamed of Imperium& as long as it was on terms they enjoyed.\n\nIt was clear Warrick had been loath to lend the game over. The lad tried to show the best of his world, and it troubled him greatly when inconvenient truths reared their head. The only real shame was the lad missed the truth; one day at a time, it was Tom himself as was showing the best of Humanity.\n\n*\u0018People lose themselves in crowds and congregations& Ach well, I\u0019ll take him out for a dinner he will nae forget.\u0019*\n\nIt would be a good Eth\u0019rovi& at least for most.","subreddit":"Sexyspacebabes","comments":44,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Sexyspacebabes/comments/176v7ev/just_one_drop_ch_107/","_row":"Just One Drop - Ch 107"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-07","timestamp":1696670876,"title":"Cred c\u0003 o s\u0003 candidez la func\u001bia de primar al Sibiului","text":"Singurul meu obiectiv o fi s\u0003 fac ora\u0019ul cât mai lipsit de ma\u0019ini.  \u0002sta înseamn\u0003 sprijinirea unor forme alternative de transport, transport public \u0019i vehicule personale (e-scooter, e-bike etc) prin eliminarea ma\u0019inilor parcate \u0019i înlocuirea lor cu piste pentru biciclete.

In June 1903, the UK Parliament debated about the speed of motor vehicles (12 mph at the time) and the dangers people on the road were incessantly being subjected to. Here are some excerpts from the debate which are still relevant today.","text":"The debate starts off with Mr. Cathcart Wason pointing out that:\n\n&gt; Question after Question had been asked with regard to continual abuses of the law, and the necessity for fresh regulations had been urged, but they had been met with indifference. The question was of great importance to the whole country. In many places in Scotland, for instance, the children of the poor had been accustomed to play in the streets from time immemorial, having no other playground... \n\nAt the time of the debate, cars were still outnumbered on the roads. It's approximated that during the death of Bridget Driscoll in 1896 \u0014 the first recorded person killed by an automotive collision in Great Britain \u0014 there were 100 motor vehicles. By 1908, this number had jumped to 100,000. The debate which took place seven years after the first recorded death reflects the growing concerns and agitation of the public at the prospect of sharing the road, which up until that point were seen as common property but were at the risk of being monopolized by motor vehicles while driving off people, children, bicycles, and other forms of transportation. It's important to note that at the time of the debate, cars were still the luxury of aristocrats and the rich but the roads were being increasingly given away to a small number of people. \n\nWason continued:\n\n&gt; The present position was that a few people claimed the right to build cars of enormous weight and speed and to monopolise the public roads for the running of those cars. They claimed the right to drive the public off the roads. Harmless men, women, and children, dogs, and cattle, had all got to fly for their lives at the bidding of one of these slaughtering, stinking engines of iniquity.\n\nHe continued that he had no problem that \"these persons sought to amuse themselves and to gratify a satiated and vitiated palate by trying to come into as close contact with death as possible,\" but he most bitterly protested that \"they should seek to gratify their taste at the expense of the general public. If these people wished to race,\" he continued, \"they should build tracks for themselves, and not use the public roads for that purpose.\"\n\nThe public perception of motor vehicles at the time was extremely negative, most considered drivers \"road-hogs\" and it would not be until decades later with the help of lobbying of the automotive industry and the rise of this or that driving organizations pressuring local governments that the destruction of the road as a public space would be complete.\n\nWason was joined in by Mr. George Harwood who said:\n\n&gt; This was not a matter of motorists and non-motorists. It was a question of the common right of citizens. A man could not take his family for a walk along the roads within a distance of thirty or forty miles of London with either comfort or safety. The danger was a very real one, but quite apart from the danger the inconvenience arising from the existing state of things was extremely great. This thing must be stopped. It was not a matter of wild shrieking, but it must be remembered that, after all, a motor was the luxury of a few, who could take their pleasures in many other ways. To people in poorer circumstances the avenues of pleasure were limited... \n\nHe went one step further to demand that cars must be identified by a number so that the police may properly identify violators of the law and that perhaps \"the Government could do with motor-cars as was done with certain other conveyances, viz., restrict them to travelling between the hours of six o'clock in the evening and  six o'clock in the morning.\" \n\nThey were countered by Mr. Scott Montagu who condemned reckless driving but asked the committee \"not to be carried away by\" what he admitted \"was the strong feeling of the public at present against motoring in general.\" He conceded that identification is a fine proposal but that \"the present hard and fast limit of twelve miles an hour in town and country alike was ridiculous.\" He hoped for a bill that would:\n\n&gt; provide for identification, and would at the same time remove the twelve miles an hour speed limit. That limit led to reckless driving, because when a motorist could break the law by travelling fourteen miles an hour he thought he might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb and went at a far higher speed.\n\nWhat would happen when the reckless drivers applied the same logic to a higher speed limit was not questioned. Mr. Scott Montagu went on to become a prominent promoter of motor vehicles, the founder and editor for *The Car Illustrated*. His son went on to found the National Motor Museum in his honor. \n\nSir H. Meysey-Thompson then spoke with some extraordinary clairvoyance, predicting what were to happen to most major cities by the mid 1900s. He first said that he did not think identification was all that necessary because the danger was much more serious. He said:\n\n&gt; Cars were being built which could easily be run at the rate of sixty miles an hour... if motor-cars were allowed to be driven at anything like that rate, they  must have a monopoly of the road... Was there to be no restraint on chauffeurs who went thirty, fifty, or even sixty miles an hour, except the fear of penalty if they did any actual damage? They would very likely do no damage because, if these speeds were allowed, no one else would dare to use the road, except in fear and trembling, and everything would have to get out of their way. Did the public wish that the roads should be given up entirely to motors, or did they wish that motors were to be allowed to take their place among the ordinary traffic, on the condition that they were not driven at rates of speed which must inevitably interfere with the ordinary use of the road by ordinary people? \n\nSir Thomas Nussey added:\n\n&gt; To my mind it is perfectly clear that there is a very great and inherent difference between the rights of the two parties, because the public has the use of the road by common law, whereas the motorists have only the right by statute. The public have a birthright to use the road&The public have a right to come and say \u0018These roads are ours, and we have a right to use them, and you must not pass any legislation which conflicts with our interests.'\n\n\nSir Frederick Banbury added that he believed this issue to be a \"growing evil\" and said that he did not object to motor cars because they belonged to rich people. \n\n&gt; The real question was that the roads of England were made for the people, and they should not be monopolised by a certain section, no matter whether they belonged to the poor or the rich. \n\nA few months later in August of 1903, the speed limit was raised to 20 mph and in 1930, the speed limit was removed entirely in UK roads because as one MP put it two years later: \"not that anybody thought the abolition would tend to the greater security of foot passengers [but that] the existing speed limit was so universally disobeyed that its maintenance brought the law into contempt\", directly contradicting Montagu's reasoning for increasing the limit from 12 mph. The speed limit would go through various revisions over the years, especially during WWII, but what was predicted during the debate about motor cars driving people off the roads and monopolizing what was once a common, public space was already viciously accomplished, the roads completely devoured by the mid 1900s. \n\nFurther readings: \n* [The Speed Of Motor Cars\nVolume 123: debated on Thursday 11 June 1903](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1903-06-11/debates/889cf022-2f38-4ef8-ab6a-b882ee2f85b4/TheSpeedOfMotorCars)\n\n* [Slaughtering, stinking engines of iniquity - NETWORK DISPATCHES](https://networkdispatches.wordpress.com/2013/01/22/cars-are-slaughtering-stinking-engines-of-iniquity-said-an-mp-in-a-debate-1903/)\n\n* *Carmageddon: How Cars Make Life Worse and What to Do About It* by Daniel Knowles","subreddit":"fuckcars","comments":12,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/17fop2r/are_roads_public_spaces_in_june_1903_the_uk/","_row":"Are roads public spaces?

The process below outlines the procedure from search, to viewing, to negotiation, mortgages and transfer. This post serves as a living document for the process of buying a house. If you see any mistakes or additions, please let me know so I can make improvements.\n\nThe following steps have to be taken to buy a house:\n\n1. Financial investigation\n2. Finding a suitable property\n3. Viewing a house\n4. Additional investigation\n5. Negotiation\n6. Signing a purchase agreement\n7. Mortgage and finances\n8. House transfer\n\n# 1. Financial investigation\n\nBefore you can start your search for a home, you will have to know what your financial possibilities are. The maximum mortgage you can get depends on a few factors, such as income. It is important to know the monthly payments you will have to make, before buying the house. There are many online calculators, but it is advisable to use a mortgage advisor. You can typically make a free first appointment with a mortgage advisor prior to bidding on a house so you are aware of the maximum mortgage available to you. Typically, the mortgage advisor is paid during the house transfer.\n\nWithin the current law it is possible to get a mortgage up to 100% of the property value. All additional expenses have to be financed by yourself. For this reason it is important to calculate how much savings you need before buying a house.\n\nList of additional costs to consider (non-exhausting list):\n\n* Transfer tax 2% if all 3 rules below are met [you are exempt](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/huis-kopen/vraag-en-antwoord/vrijstelling-overdrachtsbelasting) (Overdrachtsbelasting)\n   * Buyer is between 18 and 35 years old (not including 35)\n   * Buyer buys a property\n   * Buyer has never received an exemption before\n   * Buyer will live in the property himself\n   * Property value does not exceed 440.000 EUR\n      * In case your bid is just above the 440.000 EUR mark it can be wise to discuss that you pay a small portion towards the movables (roerende zaken) [as discussed here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NetherlandsHousing/comments/16s6mdg/comment/k27yw1r/) so that the sum you are paying for the property end up below the 440.000 EUR.\n* Valuation / appraisal of property (between 550 and 1.000 EUR) (Taxatie)\n* Mortgage advisor / mediator (between 1.500 and 4.000 EUR) (Hypotheekadviseur)\n* Notary costs (Notariskosten)\n* Translator costs at notary, mandatory for non-dutch speakers\n* Purchasing real estate agent (Aankoop makelaar)\n\n# 2. Finding a suitable property\n\nOnce you know how much you can spend on a new home and have your requirements you can start your search. The most commonly used website for finding properties available for purchase is [Funda](https://www.funda.nl/). This website has the largest supply of available properties in the Netherlands.\n\nGetting a viewing is difficult in these times and many properties are already sold even before they are available on Funda. This is because real estate agents have vast networks that allow them to get access to properties before they are available on Funda. For this reason it is advisable to make use of a purchasing real estate agent (Aankoopmakelaar). Important to know is that [a real estate agent connected to NVM, vastgoedpro, or VBO](https://ds1.nl/c/?si=14315&amp;li=1615106&amp;wi=389723&amp;ws=nb_guide&amp;dl=), are only allowed to join one side of the purchase. So they can either advice the buyer or the seller, not both. This ensures that the agent acts in your best interest.\n\n# 3. Viewing a house\n\nHave you found a house that you like and have been invited for a viewing? Make sure you come prepared, so you are not overwhelmed in the moment and know what to look for.\n\n**Location**\n\nThe location and neighborhood are important factors of a home. For a large part this determines the value of the property, but more importantly, you have to feel at home here. How safe do you feel in the neighborhood? Is there enough parking? Are there enough facilities such as public transport, or schools? How are the neighbors? Feel free to walk around the neighborhood to get a feel.\n\n**Exterior**\n\nA lot of people invest in the interior of a house, but neglect the exterior. It is therefore important to give this some attention. Is the roof in a good state? Wat material are the window frames made of? When were they last painted or do they need replacement soon? What direction does the sun come from. Don't forget the garden or terrace in this picture.\n\n**Interior**\n\nCritically evaluate the interior of the property. What is the layout of the house? Is the living room big enough? Are the kitchen and/or bathroom(s) still in good condition? In what state are the walls and ceilings? Do the windows and doors open and close easily? Try to keep an open view, but look through the current furniture and/or colors on the wall. It is easy to apply a small layer of paint.\n\n**Installations**\n\nAn important factor is the installations available in the house, such as mechanical ventilation and heating systems. What equipment is installed? Are there enough wall plugs available? What are the monthly costs for heating and electricity?\n\n**Sustainability**\n\nSustainability is very important nowadays. Take good note of the sustainability aspects of the house, such as energy label. Are the walls and roof well insulated? Does the house have at least double or triple glazing? Does the house have solar panels, or a heat-pump?\n\n**Get help**\n\nAs you can see there are many factors to pay attention to during a viewing. You might not have a good understanding of all of these points. [A purchasing real estate agent](https://ds1.nl/c/?si=14315&amp;li=1615106&amp;wi=389723&amp;ws=nb_guide&amp;dl=) can help you with these questions and he will help you evaluate the state of the house and will help with asking the right questions. He can also advice if a technical inspection (bouwkundige keuring) is required.\n\n# 4. Additional investigation\n\n**Shortcomings**\n\nWhen you buy a house you may expect that the house is suitable for 'normal use'. This means that the house is safely livable and with a reasonable amount of sustainability. Even though this is true, there can be visible or invisible shortcomings to the house which hinder the 'normal use' of the house.\n\n**Obligation to investigate**\n\nAs a buyer you have an obligation to investigate the state of the house. Visible shortcomings that could have been noticed during the viewing cannot later be mentioned as invisible shortcomings after you buy the house. You will have to pay to fix these yourself after the transfer. [A purchasing real estate agent](https://ds1.nl/c/?si=14315&amp;li=1615106&amp;wi=389723&amp;ws=nb_guide&amp;dl=) will help you spot and check for these type of shortcomings.\n\n**The seller has a notification obligation**\n\nThe seller has the obligation to mention any information which can be important to you as a buyer. This obligation requires the seller to tell you any shortcomings the house might have. Do note that it can be the case that a seller is not aware of any invisible shortcomings.\n\n**Technical inspection**\n\nIn some cases it might be wise to do a technical inspection (bouwkundige keuring). This is an independent inspection by a building inspector who will create a report of the shortcomings of the house, and how much maintenance the house will need in the short- and long- term. These types of costs can be of big impact such as a new foundation or a leak in the roof. [A purchasing real estate agent](https://ds1.nl/c/?si=14315&amp;li=1615106&amp;wi=389723&amp;ws=nb_guide&amp;dl=) can advise you on if a technical inspection is necessary.\n\n**Clauses**\n\nSometimes special clauses are added by the seller to the purchase agreement. to protect the seller to invisible shortcomings. These are the most frequent clauses:\n\n* Old age clause: due to the house being old there can be more shortcomings to the house. This clause points the buyer to the fact that the house is older and that the build quality is lower compared to newer houses.\n* Non-occupancy clause: If the seller did not live in the house themselves (when selling an inherited house for example). The buyer might not be aware of shortcomings of a house in the way an occupant would be.\n\nAs a buyer you have to be careful when signing a contract with extra clauses. [A purchasing agent](https://ds1.nl/c/?si=14315&amp;li=1615106&amp;wi=389723&amp;ws=nb_guide&amp;dl=) will be familiar with these types of clauses and can advice if a technical inspection is advisable before you move to purchase.\n\n**Other**\n\nBe sure to check the following information as well:\n\n* Energy label\n* Home owners association\n* Monument status\n\n# 5. Negotiation\n\nOnce you have found a house which you want to purchase it is time to start negotiations. In the current housing situation it is still very common to make a bid higher than the asking price. Determining if and how much you should bid. Once you have decided that you would like a house it can be difficult to keep your cool as a emotions will start playing a role. There is chance that you will pay too much for a house. Having a good negotiation strategy can help you prevent doing this.\n\nSome important factors to this strategy does not only include the situation in the market, but also if the seller has already bought a new house. There will probably be more space for negotiation in this case. [A purchasing real estate agent](https://ds1.nl/c/?si=14315&amp;li=1615106&amp;wi=389723&amp;ws=nb_guide&amp;dl=) can help you choose the best strategy.\n\nWhen negotiating with a seller, you don't only negotiate price, but also transfer date, movables, and dissolving conditions.\n\n**Movables (roerende zaken)**\n\nYou can buy movables from the seller next to the house. If nothing is agreed upon, you only buy the house and all interior will not be included in the sale. It is important to make clear what of the movables is and is not included in the sale to avoid conflict later.\n\n**Dissolving conditions (ontbindende voorwaarden)**\n\nTypically when you make a bid on a house you might not be sure if you can get your mortgage, or you might not have enough knowledge on the technical state of the house. With dissolving conditions you can prevent yourself from being stuck with the purchase of a house. These are the most prevalent dissolving conditions:\n\n* Financing conditions (if you can get a mortgage or not)\n* Technical inspection\n* National Mortgage Guarantee (NHG)\n* Housing permit\n\nThese dissolving conditions are determined before you make your first bid. If the date of the dissolving conditions has passed and still cancel the purchase, you will have to pay a fine to the seller. The fine typically is 10% of the bid, plus additional damage compensation. [A purchase real estate agent](https://ds1.nl/c/?si=14315&amp;li=1615106&amp;wi=389723&amp;ws=nb_guide&amp;dl=) can advice you on these conditions before making a bid.\n\n**Bidding on a house**\n\nOnce you have decided your strategy, bid. and your dissolving conditions you can make a bid to the seller. This can be written, e-mail, by phone, or on the website of the selling real estate agent. Clearly state your bid and dissolving conditions when making this bid.\n\n**Negotiations**\n\nIn the current market it is now very typical to to have one bidding round where all buying candidates make a blind bid on a house, and the seller will choose the highest bidder. In case there is only one bidder it can be the case that the seller will do a counter offer to your bid. Once the seller does a counter offer or the seller explicitly mentions you are in negotiations. Even if you are in negotiation, other parties can make an offer to the house and the selling real estate agent will mention there are more parties.\n\nThe seller is not required to sell the house to you even when the asking price has been offered. The seller can decide the increase or decrease the asking price at any time. [A purchasing real estate agent](https://ds1.nl/c/?si=14315&amp;li=1615106&amp;wi=389723&amp;ws=nb_guide&amp;dl=) can be a helpful sparring partner when bidding on a house who has an objective view and knows the rules of the buying process.\n\n# 6. Signing a purchase agreement\n\nWhen buyer and seller are in agreement on the price, transfer date, dissolving conditions, and optional movables, then there is an agreement. The law states that the buying of a house has to be recorded on paper. Once there is a verbal agreement on the sale, the buyer and seller are not bound. A verbal agreement is non-binding.\n\nThe real estate agent on the selling side will draft a purchase contract. [A purchasing real estate agent](https://ds1.nl/c/?si=14315&amp;li=1615106&amp;wi=389723&amp;ws=nb_guide&amp;dl=) can be used to check the contract before signing this. This makes sure you understand the contract before you are sign.\n\n**Cool-down period (bedenktijd)**\n\nThe sale is comes about after both parties have signed the contract. After that the buyer has a legal cool-down period of three days (of which at least 2 working days), where without reason you can cancel the purchase. After this period the sale is definitive, unless other dissolving conditions have been specified.\n\n# 7. Mortgage and finances\n\nIf you bid has been accepted, then it is time to get the finance in order. Most people take out a mortgage for this. As mentioned under bullet 1. you can only finance up to 100% of the property value. Everything above this has to be financed by you. The potential extra costs are outlined there as well.\n\nTypically, you can not get a mortgage directly, but you need a mortgage advisor to help you acquire one. You have to pay a fee for this, regardless of if you do this at a bank or at a independent mortgage advisor. Your advisor will give you a few mortgage provider options.\n\nOnce you have chosen your preferred mortgage provider, your mortgage advisor will request the mortgage for you at the provider. The provider will supply a mortgage proposal with the following information:\n\n* Total mortgage\n* The interest rate\n* Fixed interest period\n* The required document\n\nYou have to provide the requested document as fast as possible. After you have provided these documents and they are approved you will receive a official offer/quotation. Once you sign and send this back to the bank you, the application is complete!\n\nYour notary will arrange the legal as well as the financial transfer. On the day of transfer you mortgage will start and you will start paying monthly fees.\n\n**Typical required documents**\n\n* Passport / ID\n* Recent salary slip\n* Employer's statement (werkgeversverklaring) if you do not have a permanent employment contract\n* Current insurances\n* Property valuation / appraisal report (taxatie), see below\n* A copy of the deed of sale (koopakte)\n* Contact details of notary\n\n**Property valuation / appraisal (Taxatie)**\n\nThe mortgage provider will want to know the value of the property before granting an mortgage. In most cases a certified valuation report is required. The purchasing or sales real estate agent cannot create this report, because they have been involved in the sale.\n\n# 8. House transfer\n\nOnly after the mortgage is arranged, the cool-down period has passed, and additional dissolving conditions are not met the purchase will be definitive. Now the transfer can take place.\n\nA few days before the transfer date you will receive a concept deed of delivery (leveringsakte) and a bill of settlement. Double check if all information is correct.\n\nJust before the transfer you will do an inspection of the house if this is still in a good state (typically on the transfer date). After the inspection, you will pay the agreed price, this is typically done by the mortgage provider and is arranged by the notary. Any additional costs will also have to be paid. Sometimes you will have to pay this before the date of transfer to the notary. The notary will go through the contract with you, and if you do not speak dutch it is required by law for you to have a translator present during this meeting as the contract is always in dutch. You will then sign the deed of delivery (leveringsakte). The property is now yours and will be registered in the Kadaster.\n\nCongratulations with your purchase!

I moved here from Seattle and this is the sort of event that I would have used public transport for in Seattle for sure.

I'm always very careful in the subway :) \n\nAfter I took a few steps inside, the man who was watching me (in his 30s) suddenly stood up and wanted to give me his seat for no reason (I don't have any injuries or I'm not an old person.

One filled with broken promises, unprofessional conduct, and a serious case of buyer's remorse. I'm sharing this so you can avoid falling into a similar trap to the same costly mistake I did with Roi Levi's photography workshop.\n\n3 weeks ago, I joined a workshop run by [Roi Levi](https://www.instagram.com/astroi_levi/?hl=en), and it was nothing short of a nightmare. Not only was most of the itinerary a lie, he outright deceived me under false pretenses \u0013 with me only realizing once I was alone and too afraid to confront him because I was outnumbered in a foreign country.\n\nI am now safe in my own country (Hong Kong), and having given up on any sort of recourse, I can only hope that my experience can be a reminder for others on how to avoid this kind of mishap and not waste our hard earned money and valuable time. Even now, he continues to [publicly lie](https://imgur.com/a/pgM40T0) about the events that happened, trying to lure any unsuspecting customers willing to trust him.\n\nFor some context, I am an avid traveler with a passion for landscape photography. Since 2016, I have joined more than 10 photography workshops in various countries, both in private and group sessions, and have always enjoyed and benefited from them.\n\nI discovered Roi Levi on his [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/RoiLeviPhotography/) where he was offering a 10 day astrophotography workshop in Iceland. His profile seemed legitimate, with a good amount of Instagram followers, and some [Israeli media covering his work](https://www.israel21c.org/9-astrophotographs-that-are-literally-out-of-this-world/).\n\nI have always wanted to learn more about astrophotography and its editing and my initial conversations with Roi showed that he was passionate about his work and seemed professional enough for me to commit. The chance to enhance my skills with a talented photographer in a country as beautiful as Iceland seemed like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\nIn hindsight, there were definite signs I should have noticed \u0013 which leads me to my first lesson:\n\n**1. Stay alert for minor red flags**\n\nFor me, this included:\n\n1. Roi claims he\u0019s led many workshops in the US, but surprisingly, no such testimonials exist.\n2. I initially couldn\u0019t join Roi\u0019s group workshop due to a date clash with a prior workshop. Roi proceeded to change his entire proposed schedule for me (something extremely irregular since other workshops would not rearrange accommodation and transport for a single participant).\n3. After paying a deposit of ¬2250, he asked me to [pay ¬200 more](https://imgur.com/dBdgI7t) and that he would refund me afterwards(?). When I said that I wanted to call off this workshop, he then [backpedaled and said everything was fine](https://imgur.com/a/snL4B80).\n4. After paying the deposit, I received no emails of a suggested packing list, accommodation info, or anything relating to the workshop until [I prompted him](https://imgur.com/a/t3iobrb) for it.\n\nI was stupid enough to ignore these signs, partially due to Roi constantly reassuring me that everything was fine and that he had a mountain of experience doing guided tours.\n\nHowever, I had also made it clear to Roi that my participation was contingent on having a private room that the group was staying in due to privacy concerns. He obliged with [a quote of ¬50/night](https://imgur.com/a/mCFpKhA).\n\nAs time passed and the date of the workshop grew closer, I began to worry. There hadn\u0019t been any new information, no group chat with all the attending members, and no confirmation of accommodation. I expressed my concerns and reminded him again of the single room, before he replied with the price going from ¬50 to [¬75](https://i.imgur.com/iy6fgKL.jpg) to [¬79](https://i.imgur.com/ynV8ydT.jpg). This was my second lesson.\n\n**2. Confirm all costs (upfront and hidden) before you commit.**\n\nAt this point, it was five days to the workshop start date (11th) and I found it both too late and disrespectful to cancel on Roi Levi, so I paid the extra ¬790 thinking that I could at least get a hotel room by myself as I\u0019m uncomfortable sharing my space with strangers. It would be a stretch to say I was extorted, but I was definitely made to feel guilty if I had refused.\n\nIn parallel, inconsistent information about the number of participants added to my anxiety. It struck me as odd. All workshops I\u0019ve been a part of had a clear roster and an active group chat \u0013 NOT having the participation numbers [fluctuate on a whim](https://imgur.com/a/tU3KG6E).\n\nWith all these inconsistencies piling up, I felt increasingly uneasy, but held onto the hope that maybe Roi\u0019s organization skills would be better in person. There were still people in the group chat after all. This optimism, as I was about to discover, was misplaced. This leads me to my third lesson:\n\n**3. Ensure participation numbers are clear and a group chat is set up early on.**\n\nIt was only on the first day of the workshop that I made a startling realization: **I was the ONLY paying participant.** Aside from me and Roi, there were only 2 other participants, both of whom had a prior affiliation with each other: this was Roi\u0019s older brother who came as a driver, and Roi\u0019s business partner Jay. Despite saying that there would be [two guides](https://imgur.com/a/erJPguh), both Roi\u0019s brother and Jay had never been to Iceland before.\n\nAll this and the workshop just started& it was too late to turn back now, but I made sure to document every inconsistency and lie between Roi Levi\u0019s itinerary and what actually happened in the [**link here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MEBJJ1IsLCxBUYAo1GeSxdhrRr1BpPwX/view?usp=sharing).\n\nIn the interest of your time and sanity, here\u0019s a summary of the worst parts:\n\n* **Misrepresenting Accommodation:** That private hotel room I paid ¬790 for? Turns out they were all makeshift Airbnbs. Roi would simply empty out a room and say that was mine. We still had to all share a single bathroom and Roi remarked that I \u001cshould be grateful\u001d.\n* **False Itinerary:** The entire plan was more fiction than actual fact. Many activities were either skipped entirely or poorly managed. From ice cave tours that never happened to the chaos of misdirected shoots, the entire schedule was unreliable.\n* **Chronic Lateness:** Roi and his team were always behind schedule. Whether it was waiting an hour for them to get ready, or staying longer than expected for Roi to get his personal Instagram shots, they never respected the timetable.\n* **Poor Transportation:** Every day was a game of \"find the destination\". Even with Google Maps, they'd constantly get lost for hours.\n* **Lack of Professionalism:** Verbal arguments, incessant chatter about irrelevant topics, and constant scavenging for basics like batteries and gloves made the trip feel more like a chaos-filled road trip than a professional workshop.\n* **Dangerous Behavior:** They even [drank and drove](https://imgur.com/ibtpahc). Considering how challenging Icelandic roads can be, this was not just unprofessional but downright dangerous.\n* **Sleep Deprivation:** The combination of these factors made proper sleep a luxury. It wasn't the late-night shoots but their personal adventures and detours that kept me awake. For instance, on a day when we were supposed to be back by 2:30 am, detours and distractions saw us searching for our Airbnb at 4:30 am\u0014with a flight looming in just a couple of hours.\n\nThrough all this, It became painfully obvious that I was sponsoring their vacation in Iceland. Worst of all, the very essence of the workshop, the allure that drew me in \u0013 capturing the Milky Way \u0013 was entirely ignored. Not once did Roi Levi attempt to capture it, let alone guide me.\n\nHe boasted about his star tracker, yet I never saw it in action.\n\nHe brought up teaching me drone photography, but only took it out once for 3 minutes, panicked about losing it after it took off, then put it away for the rest of the trip.\n\nWhenever we arrived at a location, Roi Levi would prioritize his angle first and force me to use whatever angle he deemed fit. I enrolled in this workshop to learn and evolve, not to mimic another photographer!\n\nWith the workshop concluded, I do not feel that I have learned anything new nor have I gained anything from this experience.\n\nPer Roi's itinerary, he committed to teaching me his editing techniques during the workshop. This never materialized. When approached about it, he promised to assist me online. Yet, even now, he constantly emphasizes [how I should be grateful](https://i.imgur.com/mRlFJeO.jpg), and sets a condition that I credit him for each image [in exchange for his editing guidance](https://i.imgur.com/J75BSVO.jpg).\n\n**Should I be thankful for this workshop?**\n\n**Do I need to credit him for every picture posted?**\n\n**TL;DR:** Joined Roi Levi's Iceland photography workshop expecting professional guidance but faced a series of red flags, broken promises, unprofessional behavior, and outright deception. Ended up inadvertently sponsoring their vacation, receiving no proper training, and now battling over photo credits. Beware and always research thoroughly before committing to overseas workshops.","subreddit":"photography","comments":136,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1732og8/beware_of_roi_levis_photography_workshop_a/","_row":"Beware of Roi Levi\u0019s Photography Workshop: A Cautionary Tale from Iceland"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-10","timestamp":1696918319,"title":"Pune is just watching Bengaluru &amp; Hyderabad grow in many ways","text":"\n=« No international airport\n\n=« Uncontrolled, unplanned urbanization\n\n=« Inconsistent power supply\n\n=« Narrow or poor quality roads &amp; encroachment\n\n=« Weak public transport\n\n=« No active plan to reduce traffic of peak hours\n\n=« Politicians are only working for their own benefits\n\n=« Relatively poorer Internet connectivity \n\nI don't feel like voting in any of the upcoming elections","subreddit":"pune","comments":123,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/pune/comments/174e50y/pune_is_just_watching_bengaluru_hyderabad_grow_in/","_row":"Pune is just watching Bengaluru &amp; Hyderabad grow in many ways"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-28","timestamp":1695929723,"title":"Truly happy single cat lady.","text":"There are posts from men going around social media warning young women that they will grow old and lonely with only cats to keep them company, if they don\u0019t submit to the demands of men. \n\nWell I\u0019m 66 and living alone in a beautiful circa 1908 condo in a lovely urban neighborhood within walking distance to pubs and restaurants and public transportation.

As the Conservative Party gathered there for its annual conference, which began on October 1st, awkward questions swirled about the future of HS2, Britain\u0019s beleaguered high-speed train line\u0014and specifically whether the line\u0019s northern leg, from Birmingham to Manchester, would be amputated. No wonder Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, wants to change the subject from trains to cars.  \n  \nMr Sunak declared before the conference started that he was \u001cslamming the brakes on the war on motorists\u001d. The use of 20mph zones would be curbed, rules on bus lanes and parking tweaked. Potholes were more of a priority than whizzy trains. That isn\u0019t just a parochial agenda for the leader of a G7 country; it\u0019s also a misguided one.  \n  \nThe idea of making roads a political battleground has its roots in a by-election held in Uxbridge and South Ruislip in July. Against expectations, the Tories narrowly clung onto the seat after a backlash against an ultra-low-emission zone (ULEZ), a scheme championed by the (Labour) mayor of London that makes drivers of the most polluting vehicles pay a daily charge. Mr Sunak\u0019s \u001cPlan for Motorists\u001d is a crude attempt to repeat that success nationally by tapping into other sources of road rage.  \n  \nDriving in Britain is often annoying, and at times miserable. There are 33m cars registered in the country. Around four in five adults have driving licences; outside the capital poor public transport means many depend on their cars for every journey. In 2022 drivers in Britain\u0019s ten most congested cities spent 80 hours stuck in traffic, compared with 50 hours in America and 40 in Germany. The jams are set to worsen. Traffic could increase by as much as 54% by 2060 because of population growth and cheaper-to-run electric vehicles, according to the Department for Transport.  \n  \nEven so, Mr Sunak\u0019s claim of a \u001cwar on motorists\u001d is hogwash. Few groups have been more coddled over the decades than drivers. To take one obvious example, fuel duty has been frozen for 13 years, at a cost to the Treasury of around £80bn ($98bn, almost as much as the price of a high-speed train line). Meanwhile infrastructure projects have been delayed and fares for trains and buses have risen much faster than the cost of driving. The result is what economists call \u001cinduced demand\u001d: more people drive because it is easier to do so.  \n  \nWhat\u0019s more, Mr Sunak\u0019s ire is directed at policies that aim to curb the worst impacts of cars. London\u0019s ULEZ is crudely designed but will save lives by making the city\u0019s air less toxic. \u001cLow-traffic neighbourhoods\u001d are designed to make residential areas safer; parents tend to be keen. Cutting speeds in built-up areas is supposed to prevent crashes, which have killed more than 2,000 pedestrians in Britain in the past five years. And because traffic flows more smoothly, studies show that 20mph schemes tend to increase average journeys by less than a minute. In September the Welsh government made 20mph the default in built-up areas, a decision Mr Sunak chided as unpopular. But the same policy has been introduced in Edinburgh, much of London and in other areas across England without causing an uprising.  \n  \nDrivers can feel unfairly targeted when alternative modes of transport are unrealistic: when buses are slow, trains are unreliable and cycling is unsafe. But that is an argument for improving public transport. Cutting back Britain\u0019s flagship high-speed rail project would do nothing on that score; nor would Mr Sunak\u0019s suggestion of allowing cars into bus lanes at certain times. Speed limits, potholes and parking should anyway be the preserve of local councils, not diktats from Westminster. And fetishising motorists risks storing up bigger policy problems for the future, most obviously the need for some form of road pricing as people switch to electric vehicles.  \n  \nMight Mr Sunak\u0019s manoeuvre still work politically? Although most Britons support the idea of a 20mph limit in built-up areas, most Tory voters oppose it. Voters in the so-called \u001cred wall\u001d, a stretch of seats in the Midlands and the north of England that the Tories won in 2019, are especially fond of driving. Yet this is a limited electoral strategy. Painting Labour, which also complains that drivers are being \u001chammered\u001d, as an anti-car party will be hard. And although potholes are annoying, they are not the main thing people want Mr Sunak to fix.","subreddit":"fuckcars","comments":23,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/16yp1nv/the_economist_rishi_sunaks_misguided_attempt_to/","_row":"[The Economist] Rishi Sunak\u0019s misguided attempt to woo irritated British drivers"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-16","timestamp":1697461258,"title":"Three reasons not to collect artifacts, or why we should shame looters more often","text":"Getting more and more disheartened by arguing with people who are ardent about the ethics of collecting artifacts, e.g. arrowheads and the like. So here is a sort of vent / masterpost about why it's almost always a bad idea.\n\n# Three reasons not to collect artifacts\n\n**1.** **Disrespect and desecration**\n\nThis is *always* the point that should come first: Indigenous Americans still exist, and they are not remnants of an extinct race. Artifacts, including things like arrowheads (projectile points) and potsherds, are proof of their continued existence on this continent for the past 20,000 years and they are sacred and should be treated with respect. That means not using them in [tacky decorations](https://rockseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/native-american-Indian-arrowhead-collection.jpg) or stockpiling them in boxes. Or advertising your hobby with [cringey merchandise](https://www.amazon.com/Collection-Ancient-Native-American-Artifacts/dp/B0BSRD4X87). Native American material culture has been fetishized and sold for centuries now -- from [cigar store Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigar_store_Indian) to [kitschy costumes](https://www.pnj.com/story/news/local/pensacola/beaches/2018/06/07/fictitious-pensacola-mayoki-indians-spark-outrage-social-media/673473002/) to fake ['Native' souvenir shops](https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2023/07/26/alaska-store-lawsuit-fake-indigenous-artefacts). Native Americans aren't stock characters or mythical beings.\n\n**2. Destroying the archaeological record**\n\nDespite what many people think, archaeology isn't necessarily about digging artifacts out of the ground: in general we do our best to keep them in the ground as much as possible. The context of an artifact is far more important than the artifact itself, and every bit of data that *can* be recorded *is* recorded. An artifact without context -- like an arrowhead dug out of the ground -- tells us very little. Archaeology is a destructive science in that excavation destroys information in such a way that it can never be recovered, so digging and sifting  -- *even on your own private land* \\-- is a bad idea. You might think that what you're doing is no worse than what archaeologists are doing in the field, but you're actively destroying cultural resources for personal gain. As anthropologist Krystiana Krupa puts it: [collection is not curation](https://blogs.iu.edu/sciu/2019/06/29/collection-is-not-curation/). Searching for artifacts to keep as personal property (AKA loot) is called looting -- even if it's (ostensibly) legal.\n\n**3. Encouraging** ***others*** **to destroy the archaeological record**\n\nYou might be saying to yourself: \"hey, I'm a good amateur 'archaeologist' -- I don't ever dig or sift, I only do surface finds.\" And that might be true: an arrowhead found in a tilled field is unlikely to warrant any groundbreaking research. But even then, collecting 'smokers' and building collections ends up glorifying the hobby and building economic interest in the antiquities trade. \n\n# Myths and misconceptions\n\n**1.** **Arrowheads (or potsherds, etc.) are so common that they don't have any archaeological value.**\n\nDespite popular notions of what we do, the vast majority of archaeology is concerned with \"boring\" stuff; the minutia of ancient life. Not just the billions of projectile points and pieces of shattered pottery, but also debitage, discarded mollusk shells, charred animal bones, petrified [human waste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyds_Bank_coprolite), and plenty of other stuff that's not very glamorous. Once again, *context* is always more important than the actual artifact itself. \n\nAs an example: occasionally we find caches of raw obsidian in the Central Valley of California. These are undoubtedly anthropogenic (human-caused) because obsidian does not naturally form in this area. Most people -- even collectors -- wouldn't bat an eye at most of these since they aren't even worked, just buried jumbles of volcanic glass. But it is interesting to archaeologists that -- for some reason -- traders from the eastern slope of the Sierras preferred to transport obsidian in large, unmodified chunks rather than more workable spalls or even trade blanks. \n\n**2. Modern Native Americans aren't related to the people who made this (or that) artifact, it's too old!**\n\nNative Americans show an incredible amount of genetic continuity with their geographic precursors. In fact, humans in general show an incredible amount of genetic continuity with geographic precursors, even when taking into account migration and linguistic shifts. The Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation finally proved that they were the closest living relatives of the [Kennewick Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennewick_Man), who lived nine-thousand years ago and whose body was found on their territory. This was after years of heated debate from archaeologists about whether or not to take their oral histories seriously when deciding whether or not to return the body to them.\n\nIn short: the descendants of whoever made that point you're holding are probably your neighbors.\n\n**3. I'm preserving history by collecting points.**\n\nYou're more likely doing more harm than good. Even ignoring the risk to the archaeological record, the idea that 'history' is private property that even *can* be collected is damaging. If it belongs to anyone other than the public at large, it belongs to the descendants of the people who made it. *If you think an archaeological site or a cultural resource is in danger, get in touch with an archaeologist instead of trying to excavate it yourself.*\n\n**4. These arrowheads (potsherds, etc.) are way too common to be sacred, no one would really care.**\n\nThis is, again, a very popular idea that \"bigger is better\" and that the little things don't matter much. \"Maybe a beautiful eccentric flint or a carved soapstone effigy would be disrespectful to own, but this little point is just some ancient trash.\" For the Yokuts of Central California (can you guess my specialty area?), all obsidian (*kots*) is sacred (*tripne*, spiritually powerful). [Larry Kooper of the Standing Bear Council of Keokuk](https://www.thetelegraph.com/news/article/Artifacts-tell-Native-Americans-stories-12598255.php) puts it this way:\n\n&gt; I get a lot of calls and people come to my house and ask me to identify arrowheads or a tomahawk. I will not touch them \\[...\\] We believe that an (artifact) still has the spirit of the person who had it.\n\n(Also, note how this article, which only mentions Cooper as an aside, talks about Native Americans. It's the *artifacts* \\-- specifically, those in the possession of a white collector -- that apparently tells the story. It isn't the elder who is literally explaining the cultural and spiritual value of those things.)\n\n**5. How is this any less ethical than digging up burials (or whatever archaeologists do?)**\n\nAnthropologists love to shit on our predecessors, and for good reason. We're constantly talking about \"turns\" in our discipline, to move away from this or that, and trying to reconcile with our past: how our discipline is rooted in race science and grave-robbing.\n\nSo we'll probably be the second\\* to tell you: yeah, digging up burials is fucked. These days we specifically try *not* to do that. And when we have to -- usually in the context of salvage archaeology, when a burial site is going to be destroyed by development -- it should be done under the supervision of descendant communities. Or, even better, *be done by those descendant communities*. [In the words of anthropologist Angelo Baca (Hopi-Diné),](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/anthropology-association-apologizes-to-native-americans-for-the-fields-legacy-of-harm/)\n\n&gt;\\[T\\]he time for Indian experts is over. Now is the time for expert Indians.\n\n\\*: After, you know, the relatives of the people who are getting dug up.\n\n**6. I'm an archaeologist, too.**\n\nNo.\n\n**7. I'm 1/16th Cherokee.**\n\n[Unlikely.](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2015/10/cherokee-blood-why-do-so-many-americans-believe-they-have-cherokee-ancestry.html)\n\n**8.

We\u0019re both fairly close (I wouldn\u0019t say super close, but close to the point where we know about each other\u0019s issues and can hold deep convos), and she\u0019s helped me through a tough spot in my life. Recently I started developing feelings for her cause she\u0019s genuinely just such a sweet and kind person, and I really want to let her know but I\u0019m damn scared. Like now I get all flustered and stumble when talking to her even when I used to be able to hold long and normal conversations last time =5\r=«=5\r=«\n\nThe issue is that she\u0019s just super \u001catas\u001d. Atas in the monetary sense isn\u0019t really an issue, as both our families are rich. But she\u0019s super atas in her upbringing and lifestyle- super cultured, elegant and refined, while I\u0019m&&not. I think this is partially because her family is old money and she was brought up with language classes and cultural enrichment lessons. Although my parents are rich they both grew up very poor. If I\u0019m being honest I\u0019m super intimidated by her and the people around her =\u001e\n\nFirstly her English is good, and I mean really really good. She speaks with a very clear western (US??) accent, and her use of vocabulary is amazing. Her knowledge of international events is so good, that often times she is able to correct our teachers on what\u0019s going on and what words to use. She barely speaks Chinese at all (I have heard her say it &lt;5 times), but learns and is able to speak multiple European languages (!!!). Meanwhile me over here, my English is pretty decent but nothing special. I only know English and Chinese+dialect, and I speak with a very standard Singlish accent (although I do tend to code switch to a slightly more refined one around her). =\u001e\n\nThe way she presents herself is also super elegant and refined, like she walks, carries herself and dresses in a way that just screams class and respect. You just KNOW she\u0019s special. As for me I\u0019m just sort of a generic singaporean guy. I dress well but everyone says I seem fairly normal.\n\nAnd then in terms of lifestyle, she loves to eat at fancy places all the time. And by that I mean literally 4-5 times a week, she will go to some super expensive Italian/German/French/whatever restaurant and spend insane amounts of money on food I\u0019ve never even heard of before. And she also takes Grab everywhere to save time. But I just eat at coffee shops, hawker centres and macs, and take public transport around, which is like something she never does. \n\nLastly the kind of friends we keep is very different. She has a group of super westernised friends (many foreigners) who go out with her to fancy places, like those restaurants, multiple times a week. They hang out and orchard and Bukit Timah. My friends (incredible people btw) are your \u001cnormal\u001d sg kind of guys, who speak Singlish, play valorant/football and hang out at nex. Basically listen to \u001cuptown girl\u001d by billy joel and that\u0019s my situation now LMAO\n\nSo yah that\u0019s about it. My friends all warned me that she sounds high maintenance, but in my honest opinion she\u0019s just living a life she can afford- nothing wrong with that. And plus she really is such a sweet and kind-hearted person. They also warned me that girls don\u0019t often date \u001cdown\u001d (don\u0019t know how true this is though) and that she is likely looking for someone of similar refinement. I know a handful of atas male friends who said they would happily date a XMM kind of girl, but not sure if the reverse is true. 9\u000f9\u000f\n\nDoes anyone know if I have a chance?

No washer dryer, so I have to do laundry in the bathtub. I can't afford a car, so am at the mercy of truly terrible public transportation. I make 'too much' for SNAP, Medicaid, or HEAP and not nearly enough to be able to afford a decent standard of living.\n\nMeanwhile, every private practice owner I've worked for over the past two years lives in a million dollar house and has a car that cost more than my entire year's earnings. (Why not just start my own pp, you say? I can't get credentialed as a solo practitioner until 2025 so the only way to do a pp now would be to hire other clinicians i.e. open a group practice. The capital costs on that would be a minimum of 20k for a 4-person group. I have $9 in my savings account, and 80% of small business loans are declined for start up applicants.)\n\nI shouldn't have to be living paycheck to paycheck with two master's degrees and two professional licenses. Why bother keeping at this? I could just go work some crappy retail or office job for 20 hours a week and have THE EXACT SAME (i.e. poverty) lifestyle that I now have working 45 hours a week at emotionally draining labor. Seriously, I've done the math. I'd be eligible for SNAP, Medicaid, HEAP, and HUD, my monthly balance sheet would come out exactly the same. The only difference would be that I'd gain **25 hours** a week of free time. I don't know if I want someone to talk me out of this or into it...  anyway, thanks for reading if you did &lt;3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Clarification edit:** The main point of this post wasn't 'woe is (just) me.' It's about the frustration that we, as a group, are the ONLY healthcare professionals who are this **steeply exploited**. Nurses would never stand for wages that didn't reflect their education, skills, and importance of the service provided. They would strike. If psychologists suddenly had employers offering them 75k/year instead of 150, they would march in the streets. I'm not saying we should be paid as much as psychologists, or perhaps even advanced practice nurses; I'm saying the gap between our wages and our skills is *vastly wider* than it is for either of those professions.\n\nThe toll of mental illnesses in terms of human suffering is incalculable, but the economic toll isn't: The societal cost of depression and anxiety is over 200 BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR  just in absenteeism, reduced productivity, and several other **non-treatment related costs**. Same w/SUDS. We are treating the problem - MH - that America over and over proclaims is a crisis and one of its higher priorities, yet we can barely survive on what we're paid. This country doesn't value us, and it's never going to unless we demand it. *We are healthcare professionals doing crucial work and our compensation should reflect that.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sociological edit:** The comments thread is mostly divided into just two groups - clinicians asserting that they're wildly underpaid, and people insisting there's an easy fix for that/the underpaid person just needs to try harder. In this way, the thread reflects a core ideological phenomenon in society at large: Whenever they're presented with the fact that capitalism inevitably creates victims - and that not everyone can fight it and win - people who *aren't* in that position fervently - and sometimes angrily - insist that the poor person is responsible for their poverty.\n\nThat reflex is the result of a largely subconscious defense mechanism called moral exculpation, which allows the person with economic privilege to disavowal the unfairness of a system that happens to have benefited them while harming others, as well as a basic form of denial to keep at bay the uncomfortable truth that none of us are really free, we don't actually have nearly as much agency as we would prefer to.\n\nI added this edit because it's relevant to clinical work. Many of the people we serve have been deeply harmed by the myth of meritocracy, and many have even internalized it, blaming themselves for their low SES. Class mobility in America is the lowest of any industrialized nation on earth. Systemic oppression is real. I'm glad I (might) have a chance to earn a living wage if I can survive three more years of poverty working toward the LPCC-S designation, but not everyone can get out of poverty, regardless of how hard they try.","subreddit":"therapists","comments":302,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/17e99c2/me_just_ranting_because_i_really_cant_believe/","_row":"Me just ranting because I really can't believe this is how it is"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-26","timestamp":1695733581,"title":"I forgot how good it feels to wake up sober","text":"Like WHY was I putting myself through hell every morning after drinking half a 750 of liquor the night before?!

Channel that energy to look at improving public transport, instead.","text":"Kia ora, mMrena t\u0001tou katoa.\n\nTalking to employer about health (mental) challenges shouldn't be this hard, without her constantly suggesting I should just learn how to drive. I have practised before, driven around before (never a long length yet), but never on my own. So, my licence is more an ID than anything in that I don't drive regularly at the moment.\n\nAfter years of talking to my GP and other doctors/specialists, it was concluded that I apparently suffer from irrational fear of driving. I would literally lose any sense of security and do something very, very stupid. It was said that I show tendency to \"escape\" by violent means. In other words, I could cause grevious harm to me and to others if I was alone in a car, because I would have a psychotic episode. I probably will never renew my licence once it expires.\n\nMy employer knows I have been spiralling with depression and anxiety. I tried talking to her that the mental health is not helping me right now to be the time to face my fears. She also knows I am getting as much help as I can already, such as regular counselling, going sober, getting tests with my brain and only taking prescribed meds. I had to ask for some time off recently, and I backed it up with my doctors' notes. It was good to have the break, but as it is common with mental health (or any other chronic health) problems, it is not improving or getting better soon. I like my job, so I feel really conflicted.\n\nThe job itself does not really require travelling, but it does finish late, after public transport in my area finishes for the day. Only options are she drops me off (same neighbourhood, only when she offers first), rideshare apps, or asking someone from my household. She told me that I wouldn't understand just how *much* of stress comes with the pick up/drop off because I've never been there. I wholeheartedly agree, but I also think she'd never know just how much stress I am in constantly because of all the planning ahead and not being independent.\n\nI get it. Driving would be the logical choice for everything I'm writing here. I just can't. I don't want to deceive myself to be better than I am, when I know I'm not. I don't want to \"lie\" to myself that I should just drive, only for that to be the last thing I do alive. I have my shift this afternoon, and it's so hard to make it in time. I get the feeling that my employer blames the busses or my lack of driving for lateness, too. However, it goes deeper than that. For example, last week, I couldn't help crying when I was just outside and calming myself caused me go in late. Not too dramatically, just less than 5 minutes, but enough for my employer to notice. I was fine during the shift, and I think I even had \"fun\" working. \n\nShe asked me afterwards why I was late, and I told her honestly, while not breaking down this time. She changed her tone and said it's okay, but she would still prefer me not to repeat it again. Which was fair, and I have not been late since then.\n\nHer logic with suggesting me to give driving a go is that, although this job is just short of a full time, I'll have a full time job soon or maybe she wants me to extend my hours. Then, really, it would probably be impossible to keep my work without eventually driving. I get that she says this because she is concerned for me. She often says that she really trusts in my abilities to go far in this career, so she doesn't want the driving be something that stops me. She also said she used to be scared but she's really good at it now, and that just meant longer time to adapt than maybe other people. But she insists that staying in my cocoon and relying on others will not help.\n\nI feel really stupid for not being able to drive. I just don't want to be reminded of my limits, constantly, by people about whom I care and also those who care about me. I think people often misuse the \"I'd rather die than have to...\" or take it only as an exaggeration. I will die than to drive. Or I could drive then die. There's no other for me. People have suggested that I should move to a more urban area, or even completely different countries where people *do* get by easier without ever driving. That could be the resolution, but moving isn't all that easy.\n\nWhy is it so hard for people to understand? People can't drive because of disabilities and my own doctor doesn't recommend that I do. Leave me alone...\n\nI believe this is relevant on this sub because NZ is a car loving country. Good on you all.

All the passengers around me looked away from the situation and even moved away physically. I left the train as soon as I could and luckily a nice person walked out with me, asked me if I was okay, and flagged down some guards who promptly removed the harasser from the train.\n\nI was shocked, so I got back on the train, but I regret not calling the police and filing a complaint against that guy (not that I believe the system would force consequences on him.) This was the worst situation I've been in so far in public transportation around Stockholm, but it's far from the only one, and my friends have suffered similar situations. I'm so tired of men (it's always men) harassing strangers and of bystanders doing nothing to help.\n\nI'm extremely thankful to the one stranger who checked on me and called the guard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate (10-01-2023): I reported this hate crime to the police today.

We flew to Tokyo, but immediately took bullet train to Kyoto to stay a few days before taking train back to Kyoto to stay a few more days and these are my notes from it. \n\nAlso, a little bit about me so to see where my thoughts come from I am from Oklahoma. I have been to Ireland, Mexico and a few Central American Countries. When I travel I enjoy people watching, just seeing how they act in their day to day life more so than tourist stuff. Without further ado(be warned this is long)\n\n1. The air is so much cleaner than in Oklahoma. I don't have a problem breathing here but in Japan you can feel the difference. Kyoto is better than Tokyo in this regard but still better than Tulsa.\n\n2. They do a lot biking, especially in Kyoto. They have very much an infrastructure that allows for it, and walking compared to Oklahoma. FYI I didn't bike but our AirBNB host lent us bikes but warned us to make sure we do park our bikes in designated parking spots or it could be towed so be warned.\n\n3. Speaking of walking, I am not hundred percent sure what side of the sidewalk to walk on. I think left but i saw many people ve on right.\n\n4. This is for my bigger, both in width and heighth, fellow travelers. Japan is not exactly built for you, Kyoto more than Tokyo. I am 5'7 200lbs pounds. I traveled with people 5'9 180, 6 feet 215. There were several places they had to be careful to walk or they would hit their head wheras i was perfect height. And then in terms of width, a lot of restaurants, walkways etc are very cramped. They don't have a wide open walkway like we in American so accessibility nay be an issue if bigger than that(our AirBNB restroom could not hold someone 250 or above)\n\n5. Restaurant hours in Japan are a bit different. They don't have a lot of diners that open before 11, especially Kyoto. The only place I found that was with walking distance open at 7 am was a breakfast chain,  i think its called Nakau. Then several restaurants are open for like 11 to 2 or 3, then close until 5. So plan accordingly. \n\n6. Speaking of food, the good was amazing. I only had one thing couldn't finish and it was grated, frozen, pickled yam. Otherwise, everything was great. We did do Sushi converyor belt. I am not big on American Sushi but this was amazing. I also enjoy doing fast food in countries to see difference. I got the spicy chicken sandwich from McD and Samurai burger. I didn't care for either but could eat. The chicken was spicy due to wasabi which I don't like and the burger had a weird soy/teriyaki sauce didn't care for. \n\n7. This is just a tip. When we went the conversion rate was roughly $1 = 150 yen(so it may change). Don't think of it was 150 yen but think of it as 1.5 yen. So the conversion is 2/3. So anything you see multiple by 2, divide by 3, and put a decimal ahead of last two digits. IE 1350 yen is $9.00\n\n8. This is more for Kyoto than Tokyo, but is so much more quiet than Tulsa. Probably due to less cars but still. \n\n9. This is just for Kyoto but we went to Kyoto thinking it was going to be that old school type of Japan. And it is partially. Where we were staying, a cat sanctuary/airbnb, it looked not that dissimilar from any small city. There were small areas, like a few shrines, that offset but overall typical city. However, if you go towards a monkey park it will be very much American stereotypical old school Japan. \n\n10. Also, the various 90s Anime like YuYu Hakusho and Sailormoon give a good representation of the architecture. \n\n11. I couldn't find a sports drink like Gatorade or Powerade at any of the convenience stores.\n\n12. Speaking of which, 7/11 is an abundance there. Like it is extremely common there and surprisingly their hot food is really good for a late night snack.\n\n13. Also, they are vending machine culture.  Literally one every 100 yards. \n\n14. The sunrise was extremely early. Like their 530 am, looked like Tulsa's 830 am.\n\n15.  They have a robust public transportation system. Between taxis, subway, bus, and trolley you can easily get around. So if you aren't great at walking long distances(we did about 10-15 miles a day) you can find a way.\n\n16. One thing people say is Japan is extremely clean and you don't see litter, this is very true in Kyoto. I saw no litter there ever. With that said, by clean they don't mean shiny and things looking straight. This may not be best word, but Kyoto does have a bit of run down  quality to it. You will see most things metal things rusted, buildings will be faded or peeling, their windows are full of mismatched signs, very cluttered. Tokyo is a bit different. There definitely is litter, though it may be from tourist more so than locals. But everything has a nice shine to it and organized quality. And even with litter, the first thing in the morning you see are shop keeps sweeping it up.\n\n17. Coming back to Kyoto, even though \"run down\" it feels extremely safe, even middle of the night. Unlike Tulsa there was no fear of being robbed.\n\n18.  We saw no homeless people which was odd. Also, we didn't see bugs.\n\n20. I recommend carrying something that you can put trash in, we carried a backpack. We didn't come across any trash cans really. Surprising due to lack of litter.\n\n21. So people in Japan are kind but not \"American\" friendly. Like we were stopped and helped more than once(prolly helps we had an attractive blonde). However, they aren't social in terms of randomly talking and they allnhave RBF.\n\n22. Most of their traffic lights don't have a button, they are automatic and most of them don't have the beeping for the blind.\n\n23. Asahi beer cans had braille which was cool.\n\n24. All of the toilets we used had Bidets which was cool. However, their TP sucks. If I go again I will bring a roll. They don't even have one play, its like half ply. Like I love a Bidet, I have one at home, but you still need a strongTP to hold up to moisture.\n\n25. Coming back to food, their food will satisfy you but won't make you \"full\". What I mean is you won't be hungry but unlike an American meal won't feel stuffed. \n\n26. Smoking is a lot more common than the states.\n\n27. Not all prices include the tax. \n\n28. If you are using Google maps while walking and it tells you to take a turn and you don't see it, look closely. It is very Zelda like and it has hidden paths. \n\n29. If you do try Tinder, you will need to validate your age. We couldn't get it to work while there. My friend who is staying 6 weeks got it to work eventually and said this \"I kept having it go to chrome instead of keeping it on the internet page it sent me to. The other part, it needed to see both pages and all 4 corners of the passport\"\n\n30. They are extemely ruthless in an elevator. Like they wait no time to close the elevator after people exit. Like I got my arm hit because someone hit the button so fast. They do not wait for someone to enter.\n\n31. Coming back to walking, these peopl give no fucks when it comes to walking in front of cars. If they have the right of way they take it. In Tulsa if you see a car coming even if you have right of way you wait to ensure. These people are like nah I am going. And if a car is waiting to turn, you will hustle across. Nope they leisurely stroll. \n\n32. Also, I know they are walk centric but really surprised by lack of gas stations. Here we have them roughly every mile. Them nope.\n\n\n\nThese are my observations for a week in Japan.","subreddit":"JapanTravel","comments":352,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/178egwd/just_got_back_from_japan/","_row":"Just Got Back From Japan"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-20","timestamp":1697829476,"title":"I had a seizure back in June and had my license put on hold.

It is also trapped within physical borders on each of its sides. It's very tight and its very tiny with limited exit options. There are a lot of cars in parc ex. Most residents of parc ex do not use cars, but the borough is so dense that the ones that do create a space problem. The cars just don't fit. I'm serious. Come to parc ex after 8 on a weekday and try to find parking on one of the smaller streets. It's really hard and you have to get pretty lucky. If not, you might end up as on of the poor suckers parked on the southbound side of Acadie, having to move the car at 7 am the next day. I empathize. I used to do it all the time. Its rough.\n\nI grew up in parc ex and this has been an issue **literally** forever. Alternate forms of transportation are just okay. There are a few pretty good buses, but your access to rail is pretty limited. As for alternate forms of transportation, parc ex was awful. Awful enough that if public transportation wasn't good enough, you had to drive... Unless, of course, you were too poor to drive (which was quite a few people considering parc ex is historically one of the poorest boroughs in Canada... go figure) /s. \n\nA while ago, they painted a few bike lanes on certain streets, but they were laughably bad. Seriously, I challenge you to bike down Querbes in the old bike lanes without having something bad happen to you. You might have a better chance finding parking after 8. Honestly, it wasn't a serious attempt at being equitable, it was something they did to check a box.\n\nPersonally, I have been commuting by bike for years and have been saying that the worst part of my commute has been my route leaving park ex. Now, I (as well as others) ***finally*** have a safe commuting route, but the people who lost their parking are upset. I get it. I really do. But these people are being ridiculous. I was there and I heard their counter arguments. Here is what I have to say: \n\n1. Parc ex has always had a parking problem. Adding parking doesn't help. What helps is giving people options. If people take those options (I am living proof of that), you have less cars on the road and less parked cars, which means you could park YOUR car! If we removed the new protected lanes, we would still have the same problem.\n2. At the protest, there were many people with signs promoting equity. Signs like \"Let's do both!\" and \"Bikes and parking!\". This is at best stupid and at worst completely disingenuous. It is laughable to even suggest that the issue is that it's not fair to the cars. Let's be clear, *it has only ever been fair to cars*. These protected bike lanes **are equity**. This is a stupid argument and having to explain this is stupid.\n3. I thought it was common knowledge that the city doesn't owe you public parking??? Just because you own a car, it doesn't mean you are owed a spot for it! Thats why private parking is a thing. Just to reiterate, the parking spot in front of your house *is not yours*.\n\nUltimately, what this boils down to is that the people at these protests do not actually care about equity, making the streets safe, or anything of the sort. They are just being selfish because they lost what was convenient to them. Unfortunately, progress isn't always convenient.\n\nThis isn't rocket science. Get over yourselves.\nThank you for coming to my Ted talk\n\n\n**Also**, one person came on the mic and told us to \"go to westmount\" or \"the plateau is that way\". That's fucked up bro. It matched the energy you tried to convey when you tried to equate your struggle of losing a parking spot to 'I have a dream' >!\n\nEdit: I'm not sure why people feel the need to mention that some cyclists do not obey traffic laws. I mean sure, some cyclists can do better, just like how some drivers and pedestrians can, but that's not what this post is about...","subreddit":"montreal","comments":243,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/16zaywj/rant_about_anticycling_activism_in_parc_ex/","_row":"Rant about anti-cycling activism in parc ex"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-19","timestamp":1697712259,"title":"Of Giants and Journalist [4]","text":"Many praises to u/SpacePaladin15 for creating this universe.\n\nCredit again to u/TheManwithaNoPlan, not as just an editor, but as a full co-writer of this work!

Date: \\[Standardized human time\\] October 23rd, 2136**\n\n*A human stampede.*\n\nThat is what Governor Tarva had called it. A stampede of humans reacting in fear and anger from the pain of losing so many. This bomb was just that; an act of anger and despair, like that of a creature trapped in a cage. Not an attack, not a raid, just an act of despair.\n\n\u001cAnd so,\u001d I huffed, speaking into my data pad to Kevros, \u001cif you do not pull back all your exterminators from that Facility within the quarter claw, I will consider this treasonous insurrection and enact Code Zero!\u001d\n\nIt was harsh, possibly too harsh, but this was the end of my rope. The Exterminators besieged  the facility preparing an assault on the *VENLIL* workers. The protests almost immediately reignited around our building. There was so much confusion and fear, it was almost too much. I had to send out a Magisterial order for all transit tubes in the province to be temporarily suspended so the protests did not hit a critical mass and turn into a mass mad stampede.\n\n\u001cSir,\u001d I heard Kevros argue, \u001cwe saw a threat! Our Governor is incapacitated! We need to-\u001d\n\n\u001cGovernor Tarva is in stable condition in the Xenomedical Grand Complex. She has given the order that no exterminators are to attack any human or refugee site in retaliation. Now, are you going to comply, or do I need to *make the call?*\u001d\n\nThe speaker was silent for only a moment. \u001cWe will be gone in a quarter claw.\u001d\n\nI fell back into my chair as he disconnected. Finally, after skipping my sleep claw to deal with this disaster, one of the most important tasks was done. *By Solgalick, I need something to get me through all this.*\n\nI rubbed the sides of my head, and my eyes fell to a drawer by my desk. Arvi had visited me a few paws ago, and gave me these small bottles that claimed they would give energy for over a claw. The one I drank showed that to be no lie. It pushed me through all the paperwork. But it made me jittery, like my heart wanted to hammer out of my chest. And if that was just one bottle I have no idea how he was able to drink so much, and still be alive. I know it was not a pleasant experience to come down from.\n\n*But still&*\n\nI found one of the two extra bottles within my hand. Enough energy to get through the rest of this paw after not getting any sleep. It was tempting. Too tempting. I need that little boost for this emergency. I cracked open the top and raised the liquid to my lips, downing the caffeinated contents in one gulp.\n\nA soft ring from my door caught my ears. \u001cYour Honor? Prestige Officer Valho is here to see you.\u001d\n\nI felt some relief wash through me. I remembered Valho as the only competent exterminator during the transport of the Gojid refugees. I had heard about him trying to reach out to some magistrates about an idea he had related to the \u001cincident\u001d at the refugee center. I was eager to see what he had planned, so I had given him a call to schedule an appointment so that we could more thoroughly discuss matters.\n\n\u001cSend him in.\u001d I requested, hastily discarding the human energy beverage container in my nearby waste bin. The door opened once more as the Prestige Exterminator slipped inside. He was donned in a classic armored exterminator suit, befitting of a prestige, underneath a set of formal robes. His Medal of Prestige sat pronouncedly atop them.\n\n\u001cOfficer Valho,\u001d I greeted, \u001cIt is wonderful to finally meet you in person. Please, please, sit down,\u001d I offered, gesturing towards the chair across from me.\n\n\u001cSo, you wanted to talk to me about my idea?\u001d He asked, taking a seat in the chair I had gestures to.\n\n\u001cYes, in due time. But first&\u001d I turned to look at him more personally. \u001cI heard about the stampede in Bellowing Forest. There was a lot of unexpected drama surrounding it. Would you care to elaborate?\u001d\n\n\u001cCertainly, your Honor,\u001d he affirmed. \u001cIt started during the Sun March, meaning more eyes were on it than there would otherwise be. However, there\u0019s also the fact that one of our Junior recruits was almost trampled to death and that there was a human of all people to comfort him\u001d\n\n*Oh, that\u0019s interesting&*\n\n\u001cI assume that this was all rather&*reality breaking* for the herd of people there?\u001d I asked.\n\n\u001cIndeed it was. The human herself actually started to talk down to Commander Dalak.\u001d I internally cringed at the mention of that petulant zealot, remembering how he handled the refugees. However, the thought of the man being talked down to like the child he is was pleasant enough to maintain my demeanor. \u001cHe actually ended up saying some rather incriminating things, with the implication and even limited evidence that he may have started the stampede. Soon afterward, he was suspended from duty for some time and demoted to Honorary, with the threat of termination if he attempted retaliation.\u001d\n\n*Oh, now that puts a very human smile on my face.*\n\n\u001cI see,\u001d I flicked my ears in approval, \u001cand from what I understand, it was after that you started to seriously petition a proposal of yours. I have already looked into that, and I want you to know that I think it is a great idea. However, I still want to ensure there\u0019s no misunderstandings, so would you care to describe it in your own words for me here?\u001d\n\nValhi took a moment to think, likely trying to differentiate his words from the petition he submitted. \u001cWell, during the incident with the Gojid refugees, I found out something that was honestly quite& distressing.\u001d He began.\n\n\u001cGo on.\u001d I said, encouraging him to continue. I was curious as to where this would go.\n\n\u001cOne of the gojid was physically disabled, and we started the construction of a temporary ramp. But then& Jacob, the human on site, asked why there wasn\u0019t already a permanent ramp constructed. He got&well, he was rather *vehement* about it. I realized then that the Federation has done barely anything to help the disabled other than tell us to figure it out, all the while we relied on them for guidance.\u001d He explained.\n\nI found myself giving an approving ear flick at that notion. It was an unfortunate truth, placing it alongside all of the other horrible things about the Federation that were also turning out to be true.\n\n\u001cSo,\u001d Valho continued. \u001cI decided something. Our refusal to properly aid the disabled goes against everything we stand for, so why don\u0019t we do something about it? People deserve their dignity and sovereignty without hindrance. Let\u0019s make ways for everyone to enter no matter the disability and install permanent ramps on every building.\u001d He ended his declaration with a stoic expression.\n\n\u001cYes,\u001d I wagged my tail in approval, and possibly in a bit of anticipation of the caffeine. \u001cA very admirable goal in my eyes. One that I, personally, agree with. However, I am curious: have you been able to find any magisters or contractors willing to throw their weight behind this proposal?\u001d\n\n\u001cFunny you should ask, I actually planned to have some support from Dalak. However, his demotion and suspension prevented that, meaning that my success has been limited. The most I\u0019ve gotten so far are all different variations of \u0018We\u0019ll consider it. Thank you for your time,\u0019\u001d The Prestige explained.\n\nI wagged my tail. *This could work quite nicely.* \u001cWell then! I\u0019m sure you\u0019ve heard about that bomb Stampede thing the humans did in the Captiol? Well, I\u0019ll be making a public statement about that soon, and I was hoping to also announce that I am throwing my support behind this proposal of yours.\u001d\n\nValho\u0019s eyes widened slightly. \u001cReally?\u001d\n\n\u001cYes,\u001d I confirmed. \u001cI respect you, Officer Valho, so I won\u0019t lie and say that this is all for altruistic reasons. I\u0019m going to announce that I will be using Magisterial orders to expedite the delivery of the materials to the refugee center being built so that it should be finished within several paws. Naturally, I anticipate that there will be a lot of backlash. This, along with a few other proposals I have in mind, being included in this would assist in effectively splitting the herd into smaller groups so they can not all rally against me in a single point.\u001d\n\nValho considered my words. \u001cThat& *does* sound like an effective strategy. Instead of having one disagreement that unites them, the public will have multiple different disagreements with each other.\u001d\n\n*Good to see he catches on fast.* \u001cYou are exactly right. For example, I have a proposal that has been on my desk for a while that would require all electronic stores to sell both Fissan and Nevok products to remove the chance of a monopoly. Nice for the consumer, but you can see why the shop owners would be upset. And I am also accepting agricultural and crop exchanges with Earth as well, and I am sure I do not need to describe how *that* will cause disagreement between herds.\u001d\n\nValho twitched his ears in thought, tapping his claws on his chair's armrest. \u001cYou\u0019re right. If I remember correctly, humans like to wear an almost excessive amount of textiles, and the Nevok are the main producers of textiles, so that gives more benefit for refugees and more conflict for the herds.\u001d\n\n*Oh, I had not even considered that. He does not need to know that, though.* \u001cIndeed. I will have to get in contact with some Nevok corporations to draft the documentation, but that is currently the only hurdle considering our trade agreements with the Fissians. For however long that lasts, considering the recent Code Zero called in the Greater Sidestar district. Now,\u001d I leaned forward on my desk, doing my best to exude the authority I have as High Magister, \u001cthere is one last thing I want to pass by you. This is related to your position as an exterminator, *and* to a personal project of mine.\u001d\n\nValho looked at me for a moment, taking a side to side glance before leaning forward himself. \u001cGo on.\u001d\n\nMy tail swayed in tense anticipation. \u001cA few paws back, after the Extermination Fleet was destroyed, I used a portion of my personal funds to send money to Earth as well as make a personal order for both me and the coming refugees. An order of articles of clothing.\u001d I took a deep breath. \u001cClothing that is made from the wool of animals named sheep.\u001d\n\nThis was the most important part of this meeting. Valho was one of the most noble exterminators I knew of, but even then he was still an Exterminator. This action was directly contrary to his beliefs, the use of something originating from another animal. But it was also only Wool. Something that even Venlil have gathered for their own protective clothing in the harsher environments. It was a gray area, and the Exterminators were not ones to care for such things. Thus, how I handled the arrival of those shipments would greatly depend on Valho\u0019s response.\n\nFor a moment, Valho simply looked at me, before turning his head away to think. His face scrunched up in deep thought as he mentally debated what I had told him. He hummed before reaching a conclusion.\n\n\u001cHmmmmm& It\u0019s not. *Too* dissimilar from some practices we ourselves have used in regards to textiles, and I assume that the humans are better than to have cruel methods of shearing wool. However, the implication of using an animal solely for such a purpose won\u0019t sit well with many people,\u001d He explained.\n\n\u001cI realize that,\u001d I said as I bowed my head in acknowledgment, \u001cbut as a prestige exterminator, do you believe it would cause enough strife to elicit  a reaction from your main office? Will they attempt to attack or destroy anything because of them?\u001d\n\nHe huffed negatively. \u001cNot if it\u0019s handled properly. Proper tariffs, inspections, and the approvals of trade. These kinds of trades aren\u0019t necessarily in the purview of our offices.\u001d\n\nI leaned back, letting out a deep sigh. \u001cMy main concern is that their presence will give the exterminators cause to claim me or my staff are tainted enough that they must take action.\u001d\n\nHe looked to the side. \u001cThat is a difficult problem to solve.\u001d His eyes lit up once more. \u001cPerhaps we can simply turn *the people* against them?\u001d\n\nI looked at him in confusion. \u001cHow? You know how much power Exterminators have.\u001d\n\n\u001cIf you remember me mentioning it, the stampede of Bellowing Forest was caused by Commander Dalak, a lead exterminator who is supposed to protect people. His actions got a child, specifically one of his own recruits, almost trampled to death. Then, the humans\u0019 first response was to provide comfort and expose Dalak\u0019s actions. I\u0019d say that\u0019s a very effective way to tell people that the Humans are not the ones they should be fighting against.\u001d He explained.\n\n\u001cThat would be good,\u001d I admitted, \u001cthough you do know how the main office always takes such claims. That it is always the fault of the individual or single office. And Bellowing Forest isn\u0019t the same province as Dawn Creek.\u001d\n\nValho gave me a level gaze. \u001cYou\u0019re correct; it isn\u0019t. The Dawn Creek Exterminator Office has more than enough evidence against it already. It randomly approached bystanders and tried to torch them without hesitation, and now they are  threatening and nearly starting an assault upon that old correctional facility.  Let us not forget about the drug addict of an officer that attacked a woman out in the open without shame to steal from her. Granted, he had already been fired at the time, but the officers still showed they were very familiar with him.\u001d\n\nI breathed deeply to refocus myself. \u001cSo what is the bottom line?\u001d\n\n\u001cYour office is essentially setting itself up for war,\u001d he stated. \u001cThey are causing havoc wherever they go, are slowly dividing amongst themselves with their own conflicts, and are ensuring innocent people will be hurt or killed if something doesn\u0019t change. The people will recognize that once all of this is known to them.\u001d\n\nI let out an annoyed huff in response. The exterminators had been a tent pole of our city and civilization since time immemorial. Even when I saw how truly corrupt and incompetent they were, I hadn\u0019t thought that there would be a way for people to want their presence removed. Yet here, right in front of me, was a prestige exterminator in his full uniform telling me to basically shut them down.\n\n\u001cValho,\u001d I finally decided on saying, \u001care you suggesting what I think you are? Because if you are, that is radical beyond anything I can believe.\u001d\n\n\u001cChange is needed for things to progress,\u001d He stated. \u001cThat is the natural order of things.\u001d\n\n\u001c&.by Solgalick, you are also Linked Chains.\u001d I deadpanned.\n\nValho blinked at me before scoffing. \u001cNot necessarily, though I must admit that I would be lying if I said that I didn\u0019t agree with some of their rhetoric.\u001d\n\n\u001cAccording to the exterminator definition that is a yes,\u001d I sighed. \u001cEven I would have thought that the exterminators were a necessity only a few years ago. Someone who can do what police do not. Even if I wish to turn people's minds against the office, it will take time.\u001d\n\n\u001cIn nature, change is a very slow process, promoted by trial and error. Eventually, however, something radical will happen, like a mass extinction, and the world needs to adapt quickly.\u001d Valho explained.\n\nI could not help but whistle in amusement. \u001cAgain, that is exactly what LCs teach, and for this, something radical would be required to happen for me to make major changes with them while I am still in office. Something only possible at the level of the Tarlim debacle.\u001d\n\n\u001cSorry to say, I don\u0019t have any sort of answer for that,\u001d Valho admitted.\n\nI shook my ears in the negative. \u001cNot that I expected you to. Yet- I have a feeling humans might create such an opportunity.\u001d I took a breath and picked up my data pad to check the time. *Okay, half a claw. Should be long enough.* \u001cI am afraid that we may have gotten distracted in our conversation. One of the reasons I called you here is related to a press conference I will be holding in about half a claw. Since I shall be supporting your proposal, I was wondering if you would like to personally announce that proposal and its contents at the conference.\u001d\n\nValho\u0019s eyes widened in surprise, with a glint of elation shining in them. I wagged my tail in response. \u001cI believe you are someone I can work with. Having your name and presence would help increase approval for this, with the added bonus of a prestige exterminator being on my side splitting the herds of those who would complain. I can\u0019t say we\u0019ll have much time for a rehearsal, but if you do wish to join, I would be more than willing to have one of the staff work on something with you.\u001d\n\nThe Prestige blinked, as though taking a minute to make a mental note, before standing up and giving me a bow with a happy flick of his ears. \u001cIt would be my honor to attend such a conference with you, Rolem.\u001d\n\nMy tail wagged, the caffeine finally kicking in fully. *Perfect.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\\[First\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/173ooj2/of_giants_and_journalists_1/)\\-[\\[Prev\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/17932xe/of_giants_and_journalists_3/)\\-[\\[Next\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/17ehbau/of_giants_and_journalists_5/)","subreddit":"NatureofPredators","comments":64,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/17bg6x3/of_giants_and_journalist_4/","_row":"Of Giants and Journalist [4]"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-16","timestamp":1697452997,"title":"Of Giants and Journalists [3]","text":"Many praises to u/SpacePaladin15 for creating this universe.\n\nCredit again to u/TheManwithaNoPlan, not as just an editor, but as a full co-writer of this work!

Date: \\[Standardized human time\\] October 22nd, 2136**\n\n\u001cAlright everyone!\u001d Chief Exterminator Kevros squawked. \u001cYou all have your schedules! I will see you on patrol!\u001d\n\nHe swooped down off the podium, leaving all of us to head to our vans after gathering our equipment. Nervously, trying to keep professional, I moved my way through the herd towards the parking garage, stopping by the armory to pick up my new torch.\n\nOur Armorer of the day looked to be Trel, a Farsul that Estela had brought in. I hadn\u0019t interacted with her much because of the new readiness policy we\u0019ve enacted since the Extermination fleet.\n\n\u001cGood Paw,\u001d I greeted.\n\nHer tail didn\u0019t even give a wag back. \u001cName and serial.\u001d\n\nI keep myself from drooping my quills at the seemingly rude demeanor. It wasn\u0019t unexpected, our regulations dictated that we should keep a calm and professional demeanor  on shift. Fraternizing was meant to be saved for breaks and off duty. Which meant I wasn\u0019t supposed to talk with Kalek or Mute during work hours.\n\n\u001cRight,\u001d I responded, finding that I was nervously tapping my claws on the table. \u001cSol-Vah, 369-259-3.\u001d\n\nShe typed in my information into her pad, and only then did her tail show a wag. \u001cYou\u0019re set on a patrol. Kalek will be your back flamer.  You have been assigned a hand torch, a pistol and three spare magazines. Remember to refill the torch fuel down by fuel storage before you head out.\u001d\n\nI gave a polite bow, removing my claws from the counter. \u001cUnderstood. Good paw, Officer Trel.\u001d\n\nAnd that was it, I was given my uniform and equipment, donning it before I strode down towards fuel storage in the basement. Good thing it was close to the parking garage, lugging the fuel during an emergency would have been rather frustrating.\n\nI did see a bit more of the office on the way, it was still bewildering how much has changed in such a short amount of time. As I passed the conference room on my way down, I saw our Kholshian Medical officer Nhilasi doing a demonstration on how to properly apply stitching gel upon a wound and dress it up afterwards. The dummy she used had a rather ghastly false cut on it, though I remember her saying that if we wanted to protect people we would need to tend their wounds as fast as possible without *fainting* at their sight. It was good that she wanted to help people, and teach others how to do so as well.\n\n*At least& those who were paying attention.*\n\nI hurried the rest of the way down to the lowest floor. I still had to pass by the firing range before reaching the fuel stores and parking garage. I saw one of our other Kholshian officers, Nenikes, practicing his aim on the flame course with his Venlil partner Nalja. Those two had been part of that embarrassment of a demonstration last paw. Completely broke professionalism the second the Giant arrived. The whole protest fizzled out in failure after that. So they were on training to ensure such an embarrassment doesn\u0019t happen again.\n\nThough, there was one thing that came of that incident. Turning the corner, I saw Kalek filling and pressurizing his flamer at the fuel station. I flicked my ears in greeting. \u001cGood Paw, K- er, *Officer* Kalek.\u001d\n\nHis head swung around so an eye faced me, his tail feathers signaling happiness at my presence as he shut off the gas line to his flamer tanks. \u001cGood Paw, Officer Sol& Vah&\u001d\n\nI noticed his voice trail off as he looked at me, but before I could react he cleared his throat and began gathering his flamer and spare tanks for transport to the van. \u001cApologies for my unprofessionalism, but I think we& need to talk a bit once you\u0019re done filling your torch tank.\u001d\n\n*Uh, oookayyy?* I watched him head out into the parking garage in confusion as I reached for my torch tank to refill. I didn\u0019t know what he was on about, but- *ah, still got a key chain in my hand. Put that away and-*\n\n*Wait.*\n\nMy thoughts came to a sudden halt at the same moment I opened the fuel line. I had& keys in my claws. *Did I pick them up? I must have, but why is that bothering me? I just, hmmm. Ugh, forget it, they\u0019re in my pocket, and I\u0019m on shift. Just finish filling the tank and get on patrol. You\u0019re a professional, an Exterminator! Be how everyone else is supposed to be acting!*\n\n*Be the Officer who should have been there for you. Be better than the others are being.*\n\nI placed my newly-filled torch onto my belt and made my way to the van. I saw Kalek in the driver\u0019s seat, and he gave me a greeting wave with his wing as our eyes made contact. I opened up the back to quickly store my equipment on the hangers before jogging over to the passenger side of the van and hopped inside. With an approving wave of his feathers, Kalek twisted the accelerator, driving us up the ramp into the city proper.\n\n\u001cSo,\u001d he inquired as we turned to head towards our designated patrol area for the claw, \u001cdo you want to tell me what has been bothering you?\u001d\n\nI looked at him, my quills rising slightly in surprise. \u001cBothering? I, uh&sorry, I don\u0019t know what you\u0019re talking about. What do you mean?\u001d\n\nHe sighed, a breath of worry and fear. \u001cI saw the keys in your claws. They weren\u0019t yours.\u001d\n\n*Not mine&* I pulled them out of my vest pocket and& *Two sets. Two sets of keys in my claws.* *I thought& when had&*\n\nKalek straightened himself, taking a pose I knew well. One of authority, but one that could be approached. One that showed he was disappointed, but not closed off. \u001cYou steal stuff when you\u0019re upset. Unfortunately, you\u0019re also rather good at it. Many don\u0019t notice, but I\u0019ve known you long enough to recognize the signs.\u001d\n\nI tossed the other keys onto the dashboard as if they were burning hot. *I hadn\u0019t even&I didn\u0019t mean to do that! When&* Kalek\u0019s feathers encompassed the fob and plopped it into the central drink holder, his eyes still on me as my cheeks burned in shame. *I thought I had that under control!* \u001cI\u0019m not mad, promise. We can just return those when we get back and say it was an accident, but I still want to understand the reasoning behind it. Can you tell me what\u0019s wrong? Do you yourself even know?\u001d\n\nI opened my mouth to deny his claims, but just as quickly shut it again. He was right, something *was* bothering me, but I couldn\u0019t put my claw on it. I knew I shouldn\u0019t be, this was arguably the height of my life. Our training was better than ever, our budget restored, and my life made complete by a perfect mate!\n\n*And yet&*\n\n\u001cI&I don\u0019t really know,\u001d I half-lied. \u001cIt\u0019s just&Things are&\u001d I stuttered as my brain tried desperately to put into words what was making me so uncomfortable. There was something off about&*everything*. A fundamental truth somewhere deep in the foundations of my mind that was missing, so buried even I myself couldn\u0019t quite isolate it alone.\n\n\u001cHm,\u001d Kalek clacked as he slowed down the van. \u001cHaving difficulty putting it into words?\u001d He ducked his beak in acknowledgment. \u001cI know the feeling all too well. In truth, ever since our restructuring, I\u0019ve felt it too, if that\u0019s any consolation.\u001d\n\nMy ears perked up at his words as I looked at him. \u001cFelt what?\u001d\n\n\u001cThat we\u0019ve lost sight of what we\u0019re trying to do,\u001d he clarified as we stopped at an intersection. \u001cThat we\u0019ve gotten so caught up in ourselves that we\u0019ve forgotten who we\u0019re doing all this for.\u001d\n\nI considered his words as I thought back to what I had seen on the way to the garage. *People barely managing to stay awake when being taught how to save a life, officers learning how to fire weapons with the speed and accuracy to rival an Arxur on the range, the lack of any emotion from the guard staff.* It suddenly clicked for me; Kalek was right.\n\n\u001cI&yes,\u001d I sheepishly admitted. \u001cI\u0019m worried that we\u0019re starting to let the taint spread to us. All these rigid schedules, the lack of care and empathy. It\u0019s&\u001d I hesitated to say the word \u0018predatory,\u0019 even if I knew in my heart it was the best word. \u001cIt\u0019s concerning to me. We\u0019re meant to be protectors, but ever since that Extermination fleet failed, we haven\u0019t protected&*anything*.\u001d\n\nThe traffic indicator turned yellow as we started moving again. Kalek\u0019s crest feathers separated slightly as he drove, the middle-aged Krakotl staring thoughtfully out the windshield. After a moment of silence, he turned one of his eyes to me, a certain wistfulness obviously present. \u001cYou know, I still remember what you said to me when I did that demonstration in the orphanage. Still a pup and you held such a drive. Oh, how many years ago was that now?\u001d\n\nI remembered what he was talking about, although I didn\u0019t know how this was relevant to the conversation at paw. \u001cUh, about \\[16 years\\] at this point. What does this have to do with anything?\u001d\n\n\u001cWhen I brought out the paper stand of that predator, you leapt up from the kids and slashed it with your claws. Everyone else was crying or trying to hide, but you didn\u0019t,\u001d he recalled, a tinge of nostalgia in his voice. \u001cI asked you why you did that, because at the time I was a rookie officer myself, fresher than red algae on the first day of the cool season. Do you remember what you said to me that day?\u001d\n\nI couldn\u0019t possibly forget that. It was the day that I had been given my purpose in the Exterminators, and is my most cherished memory. I felt a little emotional as I recited the \u0018profound\u0019 words a five-year-old me had come up with. \u001cBecause I don\u0019t want the bad predators to hurt anyone ever again.\u001d\n\nKalek smiled warmly as we merged into traffic. \u001cI\u0019m glad you recall as well as I do. It\u0019s that spirit that should be at the heart of the Exterminators; a desire to protect the people. I knew from that day that you\u0019d make a fantastic Exterminator, which is why I offered you tutelage under me as a Junior. You weren\u0019t perfect, though. You still aren\u0019t, if I am to be perfectly transparent, but that didn\u0019t matter. I could still see that desire in you, even when I couldn\u0019t see it in anyone else.\u001d\n\nI thought back to what I could remember of the day the Extermination fleet arrived. Everyone was cheering on the fleet, even as thousands of Federation Vessels were destroyed in the attack. I knew that wasn\u0019t what was important, but I felt small parts of myself die with each ship blown out of the sky.\n\nI knew what Kalek meant. Nobody was cheering on protection that day. Only death and destruction. When Estela came in after the Arxur destroyed the fleet, I thought things would change. She was a prestige exterminator, one with a grand record of protecting people. I thought her plan outline would be great for the office. That we would be ready to protect people.\n\n\u001cI had hoped we would have been what the Exterminators should have been,\u001d I admitted, \u001clike I had hoped exterminators to be when I was a kid.\u001d\n\nKalek bowed his head in understanding. \u001cPerhaps, but at the end of it all, we\u0019re imperfect creatures. I\u0019m just sorry that the local office never found out what happened to your parents in the forest. They should have searched instead of just burning that place.\u001d\n\n\u001cIt\u0019s not your fault,\u001d I sighed, the conversation starting to dredge up unwanted memories of a time long past. \u001cYou weren\u0019t a commander until we moved here. You were \\[5 years\\] off when that all happened.\u001d\n\n\u001cI know, I know,\u001d he responded, staring out at the road as we sped along. \u001cI tried to build this place up to an office that would be worth its name. When he was still here, I worked with [Ulmil](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/10spe2e/the_foundations_of_humanity_prequel_venlilblooded/) to make things better. To *Protect* people. But&\u001d\n\n\u001cTarlim,\u001d I completed for him.\n\n\u001cTarlim,\u001d he sighed, turning to the road that would take us to the edge of the city for our patrol. \u001cI& I saw him as a danger. He was so big, so strong. He could have hurt any of those kids at that school he attended. In truth, I myself feared him at the time, let alone now.\u001d\n\nI understood that fear. The feats of strength I had seen him achieve in person were terrifying, but it was the ones I heard about that almost passed into fiction. \u001cI remember reading the report on where the officers had found Treven a good few paws ago. Tied up in metal bars, bent like they were nothing. If he\u0019s this strong now, it would stand to reason he was then.\u001d\n\n\u001cYou\u0019d be correct,\u001d Kalek clacked affirmatively. \u001cNot that he had many opportunities to show it off. The herd had already distanced itself from him, which only furthered my suspicions. Yet, looking back with the benefit of retrospect, I can\u0019t help but believe that my overeagerness has led to the man he is today.\u001d\n\nI cocked my head in thought at his words. \u001cI\u0019m sorry, what? How could your actions have made him who he is today? He was tainted, you isolated that taint, and you acted upon it.\u001d\n\n\u001cIs he?\u001d\n\nThat gave me pause. *Did Kalek actually say that?* \u001cIs he&what?\u001d\n\n\u001cIs he truly tainted?\u001d He clarified, the buildings becoming fewer and fewer as we moved closer to the edge of the city\u0019s development. \u001cOr have we been chasing phantom predation?\u001d\n\nI blinked a few times, trying to process his line of thought. It was a complete 180 from what I had expected out of him, but I could still hear an uncertainty in his voice. \u001cI\u0019m&afraid I don\u0019t follow. He was a danger.\u001d\n\n\u001cAfter your incident at the welcoming party, I did some research about those involved. Nothing much for many of the attendees, both officers and otherwise. One stuck out to me, though.\u001d\n\nMy breath hitched in my throat remembering that day. Yet another painful memory I had been working to suppress resurfaced. I didn\u0019t want to be rude, though, especially after my unintentional thievery. \u001cAnd who was that?\u001d\n\n\u001cPrestige Exterminator Valho.\u001d\n\nI had to restrain myself from physically recoiling at his name. Him and that lawyer guy had caused me to dip down into one of the worst lows of my life, only eclipsed by losing my parents. \u001cYes, I&remember him.\u001d\n\n\u001cThen you remember his story, correct? About the boy with the wool mites who spent \\[20 years\\] in a facility?\u001d I flicked my ears affirmatively as I fought off the terrible feelings associated with the memory of that paw. \u001cI fear that perhaps I did something similar with Tarlim.\u001d\n\nThere it was, one of my fears laid bare. A repeat of what Valho had spoken to me. \u001cBut& Tarlim chose to be near a human,\u001d I said, the one justification that has been whirling through my mind, \u001cthat means he is tainted, right?\u001d\n\nWe drove in silence in response to the question. Kalek just stared out the windshield, his feathers raising and lowering in thought. \u001cI& I remember when I first went to the facility after he was imprisoned there,\u001d he finally said, his voice holding a wobble of regret. \u001cI saw him sitting so close to others in that place and& I worried that he might hurt them&\u001d he let out a deep sigh. \u001cI am the one who told that place to keep him separated by a minimum distance. The defense of the lawsuit was public& and as good an officer Mute is, he and Treven posed for a photo saying Tarlim was a beast we were holding at bay. I didn\u0019t stop them, the fool I was.\u001d\n\nA vacant look took residence in his eyes, Kalek staring at nothing as he carefully drove on patrol. I didn\u0019t understand where he was going with this and signaled my confusion in another tilt of my head.\n\n\u001cWe called him a threat,\u001d he finally explained. \u001cWe made it so everyone heard that through those years. And even though Tarlim won, he was alone. And our claims& kept him alone&\u001d he let out a deep sigh. \u001cA thought came to my mind during that bombing party. A question. Am I truly right to condemn him for taking the first hand to reach out in what looked like kindness? When none else would?\u001d\n\nI couldn\u0019t answer. I became an exterminator to protect people. That was my job, but&\n\n*Can you even name one person you helped? One person you saved?*\n\n\u001cI&\u001d I swallowed. \u001cI don\u0019t know. I just don\u0019t get how everyone is behaving.\u001d\n\n\u001c*How everyone is behaving&*\u001d he said under his breath, chuckling to himself. After a moment, though, he clacked his beak before speaking again. \u001cOh, I\u0019ve been meaning to tell you. I recently got into contact with Gil Derkt again.\u001d\n\n\u001cGil?\u001d I asked in surprise. \u001cThat\u0019s unexpected. I haven\u0019t heard from him since he entered the exchange program.\u001d\n\n\u001cYes, indeed that\u0019s the case. He says he lost his first partner, but entered the program a *second* time. He was partnered with this doctor. I had assumed that something had happened to him, but he says he just decided he wanted to stay with her. Apparently she upgraded his leg brace and they fell for each other.\u001d\n\n*He fell for a predator??* He ruffled his feathers and answered my thoughts before they could even make it to speech. \u001cAnd they aren\u0019t the only ones. I don\u0019t get it either, Sol-Vah. All the rules I thought were set in stone are getting overturned just about everywhere I look, and yet& the protests just fizzled away, as if that change wasn\u0019t that important. Like we\u0019re the only ones that are preparing for& Brahk, I don\u0019t even know.\u001d\n\nI knew. *Preparing for a fight.*\n\nWe had been so certain something would happen, but now we\u0019re just waiting. The ferver I had felt during the speech had all but faded, replaced with soulless scheduling and mind-numbing patrol routes. But it had to be true, we wouldn\u0019t have done all we have done without a reason. We were protectors. We& we have to be&\n\nI didn\u0019t see any signs of predatory influence in the woods as we drove, but I needed something to distract myself. I didn\u0019t like the thoughts that were going through my head. They were too dark, too depressing. *Think of something else, something positive! Something we did right!*\n\nThankfully, at least one good thing came to mind. I swung my head back towards Kalek from my sitting position. \u001cDid you hear about Treven\u0019s being brought in?\u001d\n\nIt wasn\u0019t the most positive topic, but keeping that spoiled brat away from us was a good thing in my opinion. He ruffled his feathers, sounding more steady in his words. \u001cI was there when he was brought in. By Intala, he looked like he had been living in an Arxur farm.\u001d\n\nMy quills prickled in misplaced concern as I remembered who had deposited him with the exterminators. \u001cDo you think Tarlim had done something to him? When he broke up the protest?\u001d\n\nKalek flared his tail negatively. \u001cI interviewed Treven. He basically confessed. Said he was trying to rob a woman in an alley for not giving him her money. Apparently, he tried to stab her when he didn\u0019t get his way.\u001d He turned the van down a dirt road through a lumber preserve. \u001cI think he wanted me to say he deserved the money. He was desperate for any kind of approval. Rest assured, I granted him no such pleasantries.\u001d\n\nI understood why he said that. Treven was the odd man out of just about any squad he had been placed in. Like he was a pup who still expected the world to give him whatever he wished in a silver salad bowl. Despite my distaste with him, though, I couldn\u0019t help but feel sympathetic towards him for what I heard of his decrepit state. Still, to actually be willing to attack someone just for their money& \u001cThen&what happened to him? Why did he need that money so badly? Plenty of places are willing to hire former Exterminators.\u001d\n\nI had already heard the rumors. That Treven had a stash of Sun Bliss before he was fired, but I was hoping beyond hope they weren\u0019t true. Unfortunately, Kalek shattered that with one word. \u001cDrugs. He was on an inhaling stimulant called Sun Bliss.\u001d\n\nI dipped my head in understanding, both relieved and disappointed. Expectedly, though, surprise wasn\u0019t in my list of emotions. \u001cSo the rumors are true, then. Do you know how long it\u0019s been since his last hit?\u001d\n\n\u001cNo idea,\u001d he responded. \u001cCould have been paws, could have been only a claw. Either way, he needs to get away from its claws. After the interview, I recommended to Kevros that he get transferred to another province and& be put through a correctional facility.\u001d\n\nA correctional facility. I shuddered a little. Even though ours had been found to be a den run by predators in the skins of prey, even standard facilities were not a place one wished to end up. \u001cI&suppose I see the reasoning. He was willing to harm others just so he could afford his next hit. He\u0019s a danger to the herd.\u001d\n\n\u001cIndeed,\u001d Kalek answered solemnly as we continued on our patrol. The drive was maddeningly quiet as the silence between us built up into an impenetrable wall. I wanted to talk about something with him, anything really, but I simply couldn\u0019t muster the strength. It was all being used to ensure that my mind doesn\u0019t betray me more than it already has, stealing keys I didn\u0019t even realize I had stolen and letting old doubts surface once again.\n\n*I just want my shift to be over. I just want to be with Mute in his apartment. I just want this paw to end.*\n\nBefore my depressive line of thinking could continue, an alert blared through the communique device embedded in our dashboard. Kalek and I shared a glance as he tapped the screen with his wing talon.\n\n\u001cAttention all units! All officers!\u001d Kevros\u0019 voice rang through the set in a looping message, \u001cthe humans have bombed the Capitol! They have set off a bomb! Governor Tarva's condition is unknown! They are making their move!!\u001d\n\n&*SERIOUSLY?! NOW??!*\n\n\u001cTo all units. This is a full mobilization order. Congregate at the old Correctional Facility and the main Office! We must remain strong for their attack! We must show them we won\u0019t back down! We must show the Strength of The Herd!\u001d\n\nI swear, Kalek drove the van back to the office like he wanted it to take off to the air.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\\[First\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/173ooj2/of_giants_and_journalists_1/)\\-[\\[Prev\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1769xcr/of_giants_and_journalists_2/)\\-[\\[Next\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/17bg6x3/of_giants_and_journalist_4/)","subreddit":"NatureofPredators","comments":54,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/17932xe/of_giants_and_journalists_3/","_row":"Of Giants and Journalists [3]"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-16","timestamp":1697433522,"title":"Why public transport is important?

How our noob WH corp lost our first c4 station before it even anchored","text":"So today was a tale of tragedy and loss, but also one of hope.\n\nSaturday after the OP some of our veteran pilots found a C4 WH that they really liked, and several of us pitched in 1b isk so that we could put a Space Station down and try to upgrade into a more difficult hole.\n\nWe managed to get our Deep Space Transports safely to the hole, and setup the Astrahaus along with a POS. All was going well. We were able to defend the 15 min vulnerability and get it into invulnerable 24 hour onlining status.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5m40veaukhub1.png?width=685&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e0a747a39a1fdc8d8f7d5ecb1d28d411f06d719\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k0zf07ntkhub1.png?width=441&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03296c95a3eae57ca31ce3997cfee784e108f50b\n\nWe all went to bed with sweet visions of owning our own station dancing in our heads.\n\nThe next day, we woke up, logged on, and began bashing down all of the 8 Player Owned Customs Offices we found in the system. We also took down a POS that we came across. We managed to take out the POS and put all 8 Customs offices into reinforcement. We made plans to have an op for when they came out of reinforcement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iz7h4p8vkhub1.png?width=690&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6d3791fe83e6f3846bffccbe7e7f595dcf466eb\n\nA took a nap and prepared to wake up for the station onlining ceremony. I woke up 45 min prior to the station coming online to a PM from someone I didn\u0019t know.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ypbhlbgwkhub1.png?width=690&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=284c169452bbc1ccd0ee62758b626a8f9224f867\n\nI find it a bit cowardly to pay ransoms so I closed the PM and ignored it, hoping that they were not very strong, or perhaps bluffing.\n\nWe rallied the corp fleet together, and did our best to role the holes in our system. Our Megathron pilot managed to role the C4 entrance, but almost died to two leshaks and a Heretic trying to catch him. He managed to get away though. The 3 enemy pilots waited outside the C3 static to ensure we could not role it and waited for our station to come invulnerable. Once more they offered us ransom this time in local chat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0e8psjjxkhub1.png?width=385&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=773ab692c313d8b098a9b9f35baa2249cfd7f67f\n\nWe continued to ignore the ransom request. After all, they had only 3 pilots, and we had a couple T3cs, a Leshak, a Drake, and a Rattlesnake. We thought we could give em a fight.\n\nOur drake pilot tried to jump in from the C3, but was killed by the rest of their pilots waiting on the far side. When the station came invulnerable they put up warp bubbles around it. One of our pilots hopped in his Deep Space Transport, dodged the warp bubble, and managed to dock to the station and put the core in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yeh1t4bykhub1.png?width=460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddc106e584af46f0a5742056e10c56801d0cf423\n\nBut the enemy had too many ships. They had 3 leshaks, an Armageddon, and some smaller stuff. I did my best to try to stall them by hopping in my stealth bomber and dropping a break lock bomb on them, but I got blown up. The station also died, along with our Deep Space Transport pilot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8pq0qdxykhub1.png?width=565&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=319780170d20e5d68c5ca686af07c8ce8ff8365e\n\nBut the fight wasn\u0019t over yet. We had friends who were coming to help us, and they were only a few minutes away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/380ljxozkhub1.png?width=329&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92c88d9c425aad5e57441a6ca1c8b371b310924a\n\nAbout two minutes after the station blew up, a corp of \u001cHole Control\u001d alliance showed up, and started jumping in ships. A small battle ensued on the C3 WH entrance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d9a5ouf0lhub1.png?width=717&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aec608522302d1649aef1d0558caa833896c4d29\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pq0s8uw0lhub1.png?width=491&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d882c457b8ee42b0586e8c2e823dee6b3c5785af\n\nOur friends were scattered though, and were unable to break the Leshak tank. They decided to pull out of the fight before they took too many losses.\n\nThe attacking corp thanked us for the fight and told us we could keep the wrecks. They did take the station core though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0kwepwg1lhub1.png?width=421&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70b2345b614cb317dfd3e882687cb477a0e49760\n\nIn the end, our corp lost about 3 billion worth of ISK on the whole affair. Hole Control lost 2.5b trying to defend us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u8xmrz72lhub1.png?width=584&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c199bdd828dab2ba175d1606c0e7d8fdfc51e4bf\n\nWe are really touched that Hole Control showed up with a fleet to defend us. They were a little late, and were unable to save the station, but it\u0019s still really moving none-the-less that they even cared to save this little noob corp that we are. I hope that our corp can grow stronger, and perhaps join Hole Control some day.\n\nThe Kingdom of Bretonia will return to our C2 WH and lick our wounds, and continue to grow stronger. Hole Control has agreed to help us defend the station next time we try to anchor one, so we can be a bit more safe that time around. I do personally feel like we were not yet ready to face the tough players who roam C4 space, so I do feel a tad bit relieved to be returning to the comforts of our cozy c2.\n\nI think it\u0019s these kind of stories of tragedy and triumph (for them) that make Eve great.

Why is the airtrain $8? I know it's run by the Port Authority, not the MTA, but that is just highway robbery.

Will you ever be accepted as one of them? Are Anglo Saxon countries just better in this regard? Do any other well-integrated long-term residents feel continuously rejected?","text":"I know its long, but its worthwhile, I promise.\n\nFor starters: I am white and from Australia. So my experiences could not be called racism. It is more subtle and harder to prove; which is why some often wonder if I am actually imagining all this. I have now lived in Germany for the past 20 years (half my life). I switched citizenship in 2016 and now possess only the German one (The German government required me to give up my Australian one!). I speak near perfect German, but with an accent. But I have come to the conclusion that Germans construct a barrier around themselves when interacting with people who don\u0019t belong to their \"tribe\". I feel that if you were not born in this country you will never have a sense of fully belonging to German society (And even if you were born here, you may still have problems. I.e. not being white). There are always subtle traits of Germans letting you know that you are not one of them. This can involve:\n\n\\*Switching to English (I still have not yet met a German who speaks better English than I speak German; and this is not just me being egoistic). I don\u0019t need help with my German. I am not an English teacher on wheels who gives free lessons. But this happens to me every day, even with people I have known for 20 years! But in a deeper sense I think switching to English mid conversation is an unconscious method of protecting their tribe from outsiders. I.e. the same way that a couple may have a certain (romantic/cute) way of speaking to each other alone, Germans like to protect their language and only speak it with their kind. And here I am not talking about at the Ämter or in the train (where newly arrived foreigners are forced to speak German), but rather with people I actually know and who know my German level.\n\n\\* Completely ignoring me when I ask a question. And no, this is not because they didn\u0019t understand my German! I.e. pretending they didn\u0019t hear.\n\n\\* Switching eye contact from me to my (German) girlfriend as soon as they hear my accent. Example: I was on holidays in Greece and we met another German couple, by chance, multiple times in a restaurant. They remembered us and offered us the remainder of their wine bottle because they wanted to go. Probably, since I was the man, they both directed their initial conversation at me. This particular time it took them a few minutes to pick up on my accent. But as soon as they detected it they seemed really confused, if not threatened. After that, including multiple other times where we popped into each other in some other villages nearby, they did not look at me and their focus shifted to my girlfriend \u0013 which is ironic because she was ignored at first for being a woman: they wanted approval from the man regarding the wine bottle!\n\n\\*Continously emphasizing the fact that you are not from Germany. \n\nAll of the above and other such similar subtle things have happened to me every day in Germany for the past 20 years. They happen too often for me to be imagining them.\n\nA lot of people say it is better in some other continental European countries. In terms of simple interactions like in a café or on the street, it is indeed easier and more relaxed in France, the Netherlands, Denmark, etc. However in terms of being accepted into society it is exactly the same as in Germany; and in Sweden or the Netherlands I would say it is even much worse (their tribes are much smaller the German tribe \u0013 so it needs to be protected even more). For example: imagine if a 20 year foreigner moves to a continental European country, gets citizenship, learns the language to near perfect, becomes accustomed to the culture, history, etc. 20, 40, 60 years later will the \u001cnative/ethnic\u001d citizens accept this person as a German, Frenchman/woman, Dane, etc. Absolutely not, at least 90-99% of them will not. If that same people moves to Australia/ US/ Great Britian/ Canada/ New Zealand? Absolutely yes; at least, say 70-90%, will accept them as one of their own. There are two reasons for this:\n\n1.For a large portion of the continental Europe (I.e. in Germany AFD, CDU voters) nationality = ethnicity.\n\n2.For the remainder: at an absolute minimum you have to be born there, go to school there, speak the language without an accent, etc. (Auf Deutsch: \u001csozialisiert\u001d). This explains why most young (progressive) Germans would actually consider a 10, 15, 20 year old of Turkish/ Italian/ Russian/ Greek/ Polish origin to be \u001cone of them\u001d, but do not consider me to be one of them, even if I have lived in the country far longer.\n\nI grew up in Sydney and there I knew multiple immigrants who were in the same situation as me now: they had lived about 20 years in Australiaa and were about 40. But not for a second did I even think about whether they actually belonged to this society and whether they were as Australian as me. Of course they were! But I am willing to maintain that not one of the 80 million Germans considers me as German as they are.\n\nI originally thought it was an American/Australian/Canadian thing: I.e. countries which have had huge immigration waves for hundreds of years. But that doesn\u0019t explain why immigration is (generally speaking) much more successful in the UK than in continental Europe. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that it is an Anglo Saxon thing. More precisely an English thing: all the Anglo-Saxon countries have, internationally/relatively speaking, an English mentality. Sure, most immigrants to the US came from other countries, but these new immigrants adopted the existing English mentality very quickly. Now the question is: Why are the English (Or possibly the British) more accepting of outsiders into their society? I don\u0019t have a definite answer to this. But maybe one possibility is that the UK has not been invaded by foreigners since 1066. There was widespread unrest and even civil wars up until 1689, but it was always Brit vs Brit or Englishman vs Englishman. Now compare this to continental Europe: Nonstop wars, tribe vs tribe, for the last 3000 years, right up until 1945, and in some cases even later: Balkans, Ukraine& Think about the 30 years\u0019 war in Germany: the Swedish arrived, raped the woman, killed the men, burnt the villages and stole the harvest. The Spanish did the same thing the Netherlands for 80 years from 1568 onwards. And Germans of course were the experts in this field. All these conflicts involved one tribe against another tribe right up until 1945, and in terms of the historical mentality, it is very very recent. 1066, however, is a long time ago! Therefore, I believe in continental Europe the mentality has developed a natural defense mechanism against anything foreign. When such an encounter happens Europeans retreat into their own tribe as an unconscious protection mechanism.\n\nBy the way: Germany more immigrants as a percentage of popluation than the US and the UK! Large scale immigration to the UK also started at the same time as Germany: in the 1950's. So the argument \"we are still getting used to immigrants\" is completely bogus.\n\nSome people have mentioned to me, that that\u0019s just the way it is in Germany/continental Europe, and that immigrants must accept this when choosing to migrate there. I.e. why should these countries change their whole mentality (assuming that this is even possible to do) because of some whining foreigners. On a superficial level this is true. Maybe I should just leave (Although I have no chance of getting back into Australia at 41 and immigrating at that age is not that easy. I.e. meeting new friends). But continental Europeans have to consider this: How do you seriously expect to compete in the 21st century if most (first generation) immigrants, including very highly skilled ones, don\u0019t feel part of the society? Germany and the rest of continental Europe attracts hardly any Chinese, Indian, and African highly skilled workers compared the Anglo-Saxon countries. E.g., only 4% of Germany\u0019s regular (i.e. excluding refugees) immigration is from outside of the EU. This immigration is a movement from poorer EU countries to richer ones. At some point this immigration will stop or greatly reduce, as Central Europe and countries like Spain and Portugal are growing much faster than Germany.\n\nThe most ironic thing about all of this is that I left Australia because I hated it and generally also the Anglo-Saxon mentality. This was 2003 during the Iraq war. I wanted to live in a country that was proactive on environmental issues, had good public transportation (despite the situation now in Germany its public transportation is still way better than in Anglo Saxon countries), had good bike infrastructure (see point about transportation), free health care, didn\u0019t start wars, that had citizens who were were informed on world issues. And to be fair, I got all of these things by moving here. However, all of these things are nothing compared with the need to have a feeling of being accepted. So the ironic thing is that each day I am developing a larger and larger Anglo Saxon superiority complex. I guess I am being forced to retreat into the protection of my tribe.\n\nGermany: I tried. I learnt the language to a high level, I immersed myself in your literature, film, music. I lived in 4 Bundesländer (Munich, Berlin, Greifswald, Bochum). I joined sports clubs. I joined a political party. But you never treated my any differently from just another random tourist who was in Berlin for the weekend. To save my dignity I got bitter, I (mentally) returned to my people, to my tribe.","subreddit":"germany","comments":845,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/16tnog1/can_you_truly_belong_to_german_or_continental/","_row":"Can you truly belong to German (or continental European) society if you are an immigrant?

Chicago\u0019s [Magnificent Mile](https://www.themagnificentmile.com/), a stretch of high-end shops and restaurants, had a [26% vacancy rate](https://abc7chicago.com/chicago-loop-michigan-avenue-shopping-mag-mile/12968289/) in spring 2023.\n\nA recent study from the University of Toronto found that across North America, downtowns are recovering from the pandemic [more slowly than other urban areas](https://downtownrecovery.com/death_of_downtown_policy_brief.pdf) and that \u001colder, denser downtowns reliant on professional or tech workers and located within large metros\u001d are struggling the hardest.\n\nOver more than 50 years of [researching urban policy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oMPNYhQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en), I have watched U.S. cities go through many booms and busts. Now, however, I see a more fundamental shift taking place. In my view, traditional downtowns are dead, dying or on life support across the U.S. [and elsewhere](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/05/it-has-lost-its-appeal-canary-wharf-faces-an-uncertain-future). Local governments and urban residents urgently need to consider [what the post-pandemic city will look like](https://www.philosophersmag.com/essays/302-cities-after-covid).\n\n## Decades of overbuilding\n\nU.S. downtowns were in trouble [before the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.wsj.com/articles/americas-office-glut-started-decades-before-pandemic-11661210031). Today\u0019s overhang of excess commercial space was years in the making.\n\nUrban property markets are speculative enterprises. When the economy is booming, individual developers decide to build more \u0013 and the collective result of these rational individual decisions is excess buildings.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Reagan administration allowed a [quicker depreciation of commercial real estate](https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/1980s-tax-reform-cost-recovery-and-the-real-estate-industry-lessons-for-today/) that effectively lowered tax rates for developers. With financial globalization, foreign money [flowed into the U.S. property sector](https://homeabroadinc.com/foreign-home-buyers-statistics/), especially to very big development projects that could absorb large pools of liquid capital looking for relatively safe long-term investments.\n\nYears of low interest rates meant cheap money for developers to finance their projects. City governments were eager to greenlight projects that would generate tax revenues. In many downtowns, office space now takes up between [70% and 80%](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/07/07/upshot/downtown-office-vulnerable-even-before-covid.html) of all real estate.\n\n## The pandemic push\n\nCOVID-19 finally burst this 40-year bubble. During pandemic lockdowns, many people worked from home and became comfortable with virtual meetings. Telecommuting grew as [conventional commuting declined](https://theconversation.com/still-recovering-from-covid-19-us-public-transit-tries-to-get-back-on-track-193437). Workers with the resources and job flexibility moved from cities to so-called \u001c[zoom towns](https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/zoom-town)\u001d where housing was more affordable and parks and outdoor activities were close at hand.\n\nNow, many employers want their staffs to return to the office. However, [workers are pushing back](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/04/14/dc-remote-work-poll-downtown/), especially against spending full five-day weeks in the office. New technologies have made it easier to work from home, and a tight labor market has strengthened employees\u0019 bargaining power.\n\nThere are significant knock-on effects. A range of businesses, including restaurants, retail stores and services, rely on downtown office workers. [At least 17% of all leisure and hospitality sector jobs](https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2021/10/21/downtowns-are-still-biggest-job-centers-most-regions) are in the downtowns of the 100 largest U.S. cities.\n\nIn San Francisco, for example, a typical office worker [used to spend $168 near their office per week](https://sfbos.org/sites/default/files/BLA.DowntownSF.Economy%20Tax.022423.pdf). Now, with nearly 150,000 fewer office workers commuting downtown, about 33,000 people in the service and retail sectors have lost their jobs.\n\n## Terminal decline?\n\nToday, many cities are confronting the prospect of an [urban doom loop](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/breaking-the-urban-doom-loop-the-future-of-downtowns-is-shared-prosperity/), with a massive oversupply of office and retail space, fewer commuters and a looming urban fiscal crisis. Washington, D.C., is an illustration.\n\nIn December 2022, the city had approximately 27,000 fewer jobs than in February 2020, and it faced a growing [financial shortfall](https://cfo.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/ocfo/publication/attachments/February%202023%20Revenue%20Estimate%20Letter_rev%20032723.pdf) from declining property taxes due to downtown business closures and fewer property purchases. The District of Columbia government projects that city revenues will decline by US$81 million in fiscal year 2024, $183 million in 2025 and $200 million in 2026. Washington\u0019s Metropolitan Transit Authority faces a [$750 million shortfall](https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2023/07/28/dc-metro-funding-money/) because of a sharp decline in ridership.\n\nIn the Communist Manifesto, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels famously wrote that under the pressures of dynamic capitalism, \u001c[all that is solid melts into air](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm).\u001d They could have been describing the ever-changing built form of the United States, with people and money flowing to Main Street stores through the 1960s, then to suburban malls in the 1970s and 80s, then [abandoning malls](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/capturing-americas-fading-shopping-malls-through-a-photographers-lens) for revived downtowns and online shopping. Now, traditional downtowns may be in similar terminal decline.\n\n## Repurposing office space\n\nWhat can cities do with their surplus office spaces? In some cities, such as [Columbus, Ohio](https://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/columbus/how-columbus-downtown-skyline-could-soon-change/), investors are purchasing deeply discounted buildings, demolishing them and finding more profitable uses for the land, such as residential and mixed-use buildings. Other options include [converting commercial space into residences](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/vacant-offices-housing-conversion/) or more specialized applications such as [biotech labs](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23376441/office-real-estate-remote-work-lab-conversions).\n\nBut conversion is no panacea. There are many regulatory hurdles, although cities are [changing zoning laws](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/01/upshot/american-cities-office-conversion.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare) to make the process easier. Many office buildings have large internal floor spaces that makes it expensive to divide them into individual residential units that all receive outdoor light. And glass-sheathed buildings with windows that don\u0019t open are prone to overheating.\n\nAnother approach is making downtowns more alluring, through steps such as [waiving fees for food trucks](https://eu.pjstar.com/story/news/local/2023/05/12/food-vendors-slowly-returning-to-downtown-peoria-illinois/70013015007/) and small businesses, offering [free parking at night and on weekends](https://311.sanantonio.gov/kb/docs/articles/transportation/free-downtown-parking) and promoting events and eateries. The city of Columbus gives out [lunch coupons](https://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/news/2023/08/07/columbus-economic-development.html) for downtown restaurants.\n\nWorcester, Massachusetts, offers financial aid for small businesses that [move into vacant storefronts](https://www.worcesterma.gov/business-community-development/financial-assistance/ma-vacant-storefront-program). San Francisco is considering a proposal to convert its downtown Westfield Centre Mall, formerly home to Nordstrom and other retailers, into a [soccer stadium](https://sfstandard.com/2023/08/23/downtown-san-francisco-soccer-stadium-plans-for-former-westfield-mall-revealed/).\n\nIn my view, the growth of commercial office complexes that has long been promoted by investors, developers and federal and city governments has probably come to an end. The nation no longer needs so much office space. It will require [more community involvement](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-06-11/los-angeles-cities-downtowns-decline-recovery) to find out what people want instead. Some communities may focus on housing, while others opt for more recreational opportunities or green spaces.","subreddit":"REBubble","comments":214,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/REBubble/comments/16s45wy/downtowns_are_dead_dying_or_on_life_support_says/","_row":"Downtowns are dead, dying or on life support, says expert with over 50 years of researching urban policy"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-30","timestamp":1696032309,"title":"Elmo is now an expert on how Germans feel about migrants.

But questions quickly arose after the Tucson shelter declined to share any information about the whereabouts of 250 of the animals.\n\nAlthough the animals were reportedly adopted out through a private rescue organization that wanted to remain anonymous, animal advocates\u0019 concerns grew when no one could find a rescue center capable of handling 250 animals, let alone getting them all adopted in just a few weeks.\n\nIn a response to a demand letter sent Sept. 18 from the San Diego organization\u0019s attorneys, the Tucson group\u0019s attorneys placed the blame again on their counterpart, reiterating its contention that it had been forthright about their plans.\n\n\u001cSDHS has dragged HSSA through the mud as SDHS diverts negative attention created by its own spotlight,\u001d the letter dated Sept. 25 read.\n\nAfter weeks of back and forth, the Tucson organization\u0019s board of directors decided Friday to suspend its CEO, Steve Farley, and its chief programs officer, Christian Gonzalez.\n\nOn Thursday, Robert Garcia, the board\u0019s chair, said Farley had since been fired and Gonzalez had resigned.\n\nTo Weitzman, it\u0019s the first glimpse of hope that the Tucson group is taking the matter seriously.\n\n\u001cThis ... really feels like the first time that things are moving toward a more productive conversation,\u001d he said.\n\nThe transport \u0014 the largest in the San Diego Humane Society\u0019s history \u0014 was initiated as the local shelter reached a record number of animals in its care.\n\nThough in California it is illegal for pet stores to sell dogs, cats and rabbits, other small animals don\u0019t have the same legal protections. That\u0019s part of why so many of these animals land in shelters, Weitzman explained.\n\n\u001cIt\u0019s a critical practice in animal welfare to transport animals & to a place where there may be more of a potential for them to get into homes,\u001d Weitzman said.\n\nFarley previously told the San Diego Union-Tribune that when they arrived from San Diego, 250 of the small animals were immediately transferred to what he described as \u001csmall, family-run, family-funded\u001d rescue that the Tucson shelter had worked with for over a decade.\n\nThe private rescue reportedly had adopters lined up for weeks, and only about 60 of those animals were not immediately adopted, Farley said.\n\nEven so, Weitzman remains skeptical of the entire transaction.\n\nThough the incident has garnered publicity in both San Diego and Arizona, Weitzman pointed out that no adopters have come forward to say the animals are safe.\n\nHe also noted that although the roughly 70 rabbits his organization transferred to Arizona had microchips, none of those that were allegedly adopted have updated the owner information \u0014 which adoptive families would typically do with new pets.\n\nIn a statement released Saturday, the Tucson board said they\u0019ve been in communication with the private group who say the animals were placed in adoptive homes. The board \u001cis aware of no evidence to the contrary\u001d and \u001cpresently has no evidence indicating any animal was harmed.\u001d\n\nHowever, the board decided to hire an independent investigator, suspending Farley and Gonzalez \u001cto ensure the integrity of this investigation\u001d and that anybody \u0014 inside or outside the Tucson shelter \u0014 with information could come forward with it without fear of retaliation.\n\n\u001cAs people who care deeply about animals, we understand well the significant interest in ensuring the animals are OK,\u001d the board\u0019s statement read. \u001cWhile this private group does not maintain adoption records in the manner that a large organization like HSSA does, we are looking for all the information available, formal or not.\u001d\n\nThe Tucson group did not respond to the Union-Tribune\u0019s request for further comment.\n\nThe board\u0019s response came days after animal advocates held protests outside Garcia\u0019s law offices last week, demanding answers regarding the animals\u0019 fates.\n\nProtest leader Kelly Galligan, who has for years worked with the Tucson shelter as the president of the board of the Bisbee Animal Shelter, says the goal was to demand action from the Tucson board.\n\n\u001cThis organization is much needed in this part of Arizona, and we can\u0019t afford for them to go down, so the board needs to do their job,\u001d Galligan said. \u001cI think this is just going to be the impetus for the overhaul that was really needed anyway with the leadership.\u001d\n\nAnimal advocates have also created a Change.org petition to demand the Tucson group be held accountable.\n\nThe petition, which had over 19,000 signatures as of Wednesday, details some advocates\u0019 suspicions that the missing animals may have been sold as live food for snakes.\n\nWeitzman has also heard these suspicions but had yet to hear direct confirmation of the animals\u0019 fates from the Tucson shelter as of Tuesday.\n\n\u001cWe want to stay optimistic, but it\u0019s just getting harder and harder to do so,\u001d he said.\n\nWeitzman says that he and the San Diego group won\u0019t be letting up pressure either.\n\nAnyone with information can contact the Humane Society of Southern Arizona\u0019s board of directors via email at board@hssaz.org.

Cross owning happens in many other Vietnamese conglomerates (say, FLC, Van Thinh Phat, etc&), and even around the world, but there are more on the Vingroup ecosystem, at a different level, read on.\n\n**The entangled web of Vingroup**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nuskv7xu4ltb1.png?width=5000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34620d12c8f9c31d27a285bd29249f3dfa4145f9\n\nIt is a huge picture, zoom in for details (click on the image to open the image in a separate tab to view in full size).\n\nIsn\u0019t the picture \"beautiful\"?\n\nVuong Pham is a \u001cgreat artist\u001d, isn\u0019t he?\n\n***Legends:***\n\n\\- Green border: company child level 1 with respecting to Vingroup, where Vingroup directly owns a portion of it\n\n\\- Red border: company child level 2, reaching Vingroup through 1 company up.\n\n\\- Blue border: company child level 3, reaching Vingroup through 2 company up.\n\n\\- Yellow border: company child level 4, reaching Vingroup through 3 company up.\n\n\\- Boxes with color-filled background (the color is the same as the border but lighter for visualization): those with 3 or more children. These are hub companies, important companies in the network.\n\n\\- The percentage inside the box is the % owned (controlled) by Vingroup, directly owned plus sum of all indirectly owned through other companies in the network.\n\n\\- The gray arrows indicate the relationship from the parent to the child.\n\nNote that the company child level 1 to 4 is to help you visualize the network and the relationship among the companies (nodes in the network), but since Vingroup controls more than 50% in each of the node, Vingroup is in full control of the entire network: it can directly influence any of these node as it wants. And since Vingroup is controlled by Vuong Pham, Vuong Pham is in control of every node and the entire network.\n\nThese are those VIC owns more than 50%, there might be some companies VIC owned less than 50%, but still owned and controlled by Vuong Pham, not showing up in the network (such as Asian Star, VIG, etc...)\n\n**Interesting insights from the data**\n\nOnce having mapped out the network, we can draw many interesting insights. See the full stats at the end of the post. Here are the medals:\n\nCan Gio company has the most parent, 5 parents. Then Sado, Sai Dong Urban Development, Delta has the distinguish of having 4 parents. 19 other companies have 3 parents. See the full list at the end of the post. Having more than 1 parents from the same network is shady, it could mean fake capital contribution (not always, but could be, just saying).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2erqjhmv6ltb1.png?width=453&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e560eb6c32e56af650c485831e58fdc509359863\n\nVingroup has the most children, 26. Next come Vinhomes with 22. Vinpearl and Metropolis Hanoi each  has 11 children.  Companies with many children are important one in the network (those with shaded backgrounds).\n\nHere is the kicker, for fun: Vincom Security has 10 children. Though the percentage of owning by Vincom Security in each company is small, less than 1% in each case, it is just for fun: now you know why Vincom Security (who takes care of security in Vinhomes towns) is really powerful! /snark See the full list at the end of the post.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cmifhxpx6ltb1.png?width=453&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad196dc08eb247f7c6379a5d4debb6a1d29cef9f\n\nThese are companies with the distinguished of being owned 100% by Vingroup: VT Vinbus, Vincom Security, VinFa, Vinpro, World Academy. Even though VinPro has no activies, the VinPro shops have been closed years ago, and there is no activities for VinPro, Vuong Pham still keeps VinPro on the book, probably as a shell for later use. See the full list at the end of the post for those that are owned by more than 70% by Vingroup.\n\nDo you know that Vingroup has 7 companies in the Mineral mining / Stone industry?\n\n**The Vinfast tree**\n\nThe Vinfast tree is on the right in the Vingroup\u0019s web picture. It is pretty clean, compared to the portion on the left in real estate. It is really auto industry. Vuong Pham takes money from the left portion of the picture to pump into the right portion of the picture, so to speak.\n\nThe red arrows in the below pictures indicates money lending from which entities in the network to Vinfast in the past. At June 2023, the debt to these companies and VIC is $1.546B.\n\nClick on the image to open in a separate tab to view in full size.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5m5g38977ltb1.png?width=5000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b98aa86d87754333b27e76824a0d14d76441c73\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ycjj4317ltb1.png?width=1106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=126444cec4fed82aad31cb39b425552e313fd217\n\n**GSM**\n\nWhy don\u0019t we see GSM in the network? Because GSM is directly owned by Vuong Pham 100%, not through VIC so it does not show up in the network or in Vingroup report (as of 5/31/2023. VIC pumped about 300B VND into GSM recently in Q3 though). Same for Asian Star. And VIG.\n\n**The black hole VIG (Vietnam Investment Group)**\n\nVuong Pham has another huge financial vehicle: VIG (Vietnam Investment Group). This is a private company, escaping from the public filings endured by Vinfast, Vingroup, Vinhomes. So, this is virtually a black hole, controlled by Vuong Pham. This one does not show up in the network.\n\nEven without having the money, VIG took in Vinfast ICE plant at $1B at the stroke of a pen. Isn\u0019t this \u001cmarvelous\u001d? No question on how VIG gets the money (it doesn\u0019t have, 100% sure, it is just an accounting trick).\n\nMany companies in the network shows Vingroup\u0019s ownership at 69-70%. We know this because Vingroup has to file reports. The other 30% will likely be owned by VIG, but since VIG is private, it does not have to report this figure. How do we know this? Look at the case of Lang Van, where Vuong Pham inadvertently showed his hand. Vingroup owned about 70% of Lang Van at the end of Dec 2022, and at the end of May, it now owns 99% of Lang Van. Clearly, Vuong Pham moved the 30% from VIG back to Vingroup. He is in short of cash (this is 100% sure), in control of Lang Van already, no need and no money to buy 30% from outsiders. It must had been transferred from VIG. Read more on this Lang Van in Part 1: [Part 1: How Vuong Pham move companies ownership around like wood blocks : VinFastCommunity (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VinFastCommunity/comments/174mdfp/part_1_how_vuong_pham_move_companies_ownership/)\n\nHe has also unloaded many of the companies in VIC to 0%. He may have closed those, sold them, or *he may have transferred them back to VIG (VIG is a group), recording some profit on the VIC side*! VIG can take all the loss and debt as much as possible. No limit.\n\nVIG is a black hole aka a mysterious and a huge object in the universe of companies by Vuong Pham. As the real black hole in physics, where nothing can escape from, VIG is the financial black hole with no information coming out.\n\nIf I have to bet, and I can bet the house, VIG sits on a huge loss to the tune of billions of dollars, but no one knows. Of course, I am not Vuong Pham, **VIG is a the best kept secret of Vuong Pham**, but base on my analysis shown above, base on what I have seen in many other cases in my past experiences, I guess / predict that VIG is at a huge loss. Proof? Just look at how VIG took in the $1B ICE plant as an evidence! VIG clearly did not have that amount of free money on hand, 100% sure, but it took the ICE plant in anyway because Vuong Pham could, at a huge debt and loss. And that is just *one* case. For the full company VIG, it won\u0019t be surprise if the debt and loss are in the billions of dollars.\n\n***VIG\u0019s role is to carry the loss for VIC and other Vuong Pham\u0019s companies and pump fake profit into VIC when needed*** (for example, VIC was pumped with \u001cfinancial gain\u001d a few quarter back to turn red operating loss to a small profit, avoiding stock margin cut by the Vietnamese SEC). At astronomical levels, hundreds to billions of dollars. For example, in 2020, VIC recorded 28,600 Billion VND (about $1.2B) in financial profits just from transferring companies.\n\nIf you have friends working in fiance on wall street with 10+ years of experience at senior levels (junior level won\u0019t know), send this post to them and ask them for opinions if I am right.\n\nIf you are not in finance and still don\u0019t get how shady and serious this is, let\u0019s this section sink in for a while. Come back tomorrow to re-read this.\n\nSome of you have heard about VIG, but how many of you are aware of the ramification as outlined above?\n\nFor illustration: the two universes:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1twdxi1d7ltb1.png?width=1681&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8dfaca122ee0ca69b9ee99844c3948c8f85abb4\n\n**Summary**\n\nI have given you the visualization of the full network of Vingroup. Look at the network picture at the top of the post and you may find some patterns there yourself. May be you can find out something that I have missed.\n\nIsn\u0019t the entangled web of Vingroup \u001cincredible\u001d? Have you known about this before? Or have seen anything like this before?\n\nAnd I have also unveiled the hidden black hole VIG for all of you to see.\n\nVingroup is a house of cards, building upon debts taken from shell companies. It will never be able to repay all the debts, just borrowing new debt to pay old debt. If the economy is good, it can still flip the debt when the debt matures and just pay the interest and keep going for 10 20 years or more, just kicking the debt down the road. When the economy gone bad and business gone bad, the debt will increase at a faster rate. Since the debt are borrowed again shell companies without real business using inflated values in real estate and mining and services, there is no cure. *It was money out of emptiness*.\n\nThe house of cards destines to crumble under the gravity of debt, i.e. the laws of business. Unless Vuong Pham can create his own universe with different laws of business, can\u0019t he?\n\n\\------\n\n**Exhibitions**\n\n**Parents**\n\nCompanies has 5 parents (1): Can Gio Urban\n\nCompanies

If you see an entry like \"Vacation 200/month\", remember that I assumed 2400 CAD for a vacation but simply divided it by 12 because I am creating a monthly budget but including one time purchases done in a year too. I am not claiming a family would go to vacation every month and spend 200 CAD. I am assuming the family owns a single car.\n\nMonthly Breakdown for a family of 4 with 2 kids at school age\n\n* Rent (3(edit:2) bedroom, midtown) = 3000\n* Utilities = 150\n* Gas = 100\n* 2 Mobile phone plans = 100\n* Home Internet = 75\n* Grocery (includes lunch and snacks for kids they take school with them, fruits etc) = 1500\n* Toiletries/Detergent/Dishwasher capsules/Rinse/Baking Soda/Shampoo/Deodorants/Toilet Paper/Wet Wipes/Tooth Brush/Tooth Paste/House cleaning stuff Etc = 100\n* Insurance (Car + Rental) = 250 \\[For a new comer, easily close to 350 or even 400\\]\n* Kids Clothing (winter coats, jackets, snow pants, rain boots, snow boots, indoor shoes, thermal underwears being the biggest contributers) = 100\n* Adults Clothing = 50\n* Car Maintenance (Tire change twice a year, car wash, oil change etc. Not including heavy maintenance) = 60\n* Summer Vacation, 1 week (modest, in Ontario) = 250\n* Winter Vacation, Long Weekend or 4 days, Blue Mountain etc.. = 80\n* Subscriptions (spotify, youtube plus, netflix etc) = 50\n* Summer Camp for kids for 9 weeks (if both parents working) =  300\n* Before School and After School for 10 months for 2 kids (if both parents working) = 700\n* 2 activities with kids a year (monster jam / wonderland etc) = 50\n* Dining out, Coffee, Ice Cream, Comfort/Junk Food, Parking, Occasional Public Transport = 150\n* Various gifts, occasions (halloween costumes, gift cards for teachers, school trips, birthday party presents etc) = 100\n\nSum \\~ 7150 CAD / month\n\nReminder this does not include car payments (we assumed car is owned). No alcohol, smoking etc.. Very modest in activities and hobbies, close to zero. Not including any sort of furniture as well. Not including any electronics like renewing mobile phones, laptops etc.\n\nIf both parents are not working before school, after school and summer camp can be disregarded in which case total comes down to \\~6150 CAD / month.\n\nAssuming 80k gross per parent, that is \\~5k net per month and 10k net HHI, this family can save the remaining 30% . Assuming both parents making 60k gross, this family can live close to paycheck to paycheck.\n\nFor the single parent scenario where 6000 CAD a month is needed, the gross income needed will be 100k annually.\n\nHope it helps.","subreddit":"PersonalFinanceCanada","comments":323,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/177dbil/cost_of_living_for_a_family_of_4_in_toronto_in/","_row":"Cost of living for a family of 4 in Toronto in 2023.."},{"date_utc":"2023-10-10","timestamp":1696953204,"title":"Walkability and disability","text":"Ah, our favourite argument. How will the disabled get around? Well, I am currently recovering from major surgery and in a wheelchair. I can walk a bit but not too much. I'm off for 2 months, and my husband took 3 weeks off to take care of me. And we figured it would be good if I wasn't stuck in the flat all the time. Fortunately, we live in a walkable city, so I don't have to be! Every day we've been going out, either for a half hour zoom around the block, or for a bigger expedition. He has good stamina, so his wheelie range is pretty vast, but even then, there's accessible public transport if we want to go further afield. I've been home a week and so far we've been: to a nice, big park, a pedestrianised plaza, to some smaller parks nearby, and to two museums. One had an exhibition about trains!  \n\nAnd let me tell you, it's been doing wonders for my health, both physical and mental. I get some fresh air, I get to see nice sights, and I feel like I'm on a mini holiday, where I don't have to rush and can take things easy. I get to see some bits of the city I haven't been to in ages. It's just wonderful all around. Would I rather not have a 30cm incision, pain and digestive issues? Yes, probably. But if I have to deal with all that, I'll at least do something I enjoy.

We visited Toronto for 6 days: A Novel","text":"My husband and I visited your city in early October and I wanted to share our itinerary and experiences! Originally the plan was to visit Niagara Falls for our anniversary then it morphed from there, so we had the pleasure of exploring Toronto for six days while my MIL graciously watched our toddler - giving us a lovely chance to reconnect and explore. You all gave me great recommendations in /r/askTO\n\nThis is long but I hope entertaining. If not,...TL;DR is bulleted our itinerary under each day of the week.\n\nDay 1:\n\n* Kaka sushi buffet\n* Nathan Phillips Square\n* Grange Park\n* Toronto Public Library\n* A lot of aimless walking\n\nAfter driving through grueling Boston traffic to Logan airport in the morning, we flew and landed at Pearson airport in the afternoon, and OF COURSE the UP Express had a \"signaling issue\" and was out of service just as we stepped up to the ticket machine. The area quickly filled with travelers in the same boat as us, so I downloaded Uber and we got a ride to the hotel. After checking in we chose KAKA sushi buffet because we were so hungry. Had our first \"city character encounter\" as we called them...We walked to Nathan Phillips Square next which seemed fitting with a huge Toronto sign, cool! It was a...very concrete area. Maybe it's more lively in the summer? We took our touristy photo and walked on through Grange Park where my husband tried to befriend the black squirrels (they're gray in MA). More walking. We stopped at one of your libraries as respite (aka our of the sun and googling where to go next). I bought a slushie at a cafe then we head to a pharmacy to buy distilled water for my husband's CPAP machine, but just our luck there was a cash only sign on the door so we walked further to a store I think had \"tire\" in the name but did not sell tires. Got back to the hotel very tired and carrying a big jug of distilled water and powerade with no bag and realized we forgot to buy snacks! So that sucked.\n\nDay 2:\n\n* UFO Restaurant\n* West Queen West\n* Trinity Bellwoods Park\n* CN Tower\n* Ripley's Aquarium\n* St Lawrence Market\n* Dog Fountain\n* Loblaw's dinner\n\nWe didn't have much of a plan beyond Vietnemese breakfast at UFO and exploring West Queen West by recommendation. Unfortunately a lot of shops were not open yet as we walked, but we did get a book at TYPE books and a probably-too-expensive toy for our toddler at Kol Kid. Coffee in hand, we sat at the edge of Trinity Bellwoods Park and decided since it was such a nice day, to do CN Tower today for the best view. We made a lunch reservation and for some ungodly reason, decided to walk to it.Dining at CN Tower was definitely worth it! Amazing experience eating while the city spins around us and food was great, especially the desserts. I felt underdressed since we didn't plan on going that day, oh well.We then visited Ripley's Aquarium which was fantastic! I'm so used to New England Aquarium which is centered around one giant tank you spiral up and around, that all the different tanks were delightful. The octopus was HUGE! And jellyfish tank soooo cool. And that moving platform through the tank tunnels and sharks and turtles swimming around and overhead? Phenomenal. I also liked how they show you the filtration tanks. What a great aquarium, especially for kids.There was still plenty of day left so we walked (so much walking...) to St Lawrence Market and explored. Bought fancy honey and treats. We were about to eat but alas, our option was cash only. So we grabbed coffees and sat around Berczy Park Dog Fountain. We decided to end the day with a romantic grocery store sandwich and rice ball dinner at Loblaws to balance out our insane lunch bill.\n\nDay 3:\n\n* Tim Hortons\n* Niagara Falls\n* Journey Behind the Fall\n* Flying Saucer restaurant\n* Hornblower\n* Clifton Park Wendys\n\nTime for Niagara Falls! The public transport experience around the Falls was the worst part of our trip. We took the morning GO Train which was a smooth ride with the downside we had a long-ass day until the 9pm train. (Also I am still confused on ticket scanning. No one ever checked our GO tickets. I never understood scanning tickets after we hop off, and if that was even the case for GO when the little kiosk scanners say Presto?) I know we need to buy a WeGo ticket. No problem the (outdated) train announcement even said so. I look on my phone and the WeGo website is far from helpful. All I see is a 2-day pass on a different website.\n\nWe are unceremoniously deposited at Niagara and the important looking building we're dropped off at is closed so we walk to a rickety bus stop that looks like it's out of a road trip comedy movie. It sure gave that experience because there was no toilet paper in my stall so thank goodness I had stuffed a napkin in my pocket from my bland Tim Hortons breakfast. Cherry on top after the bathroom is my husband informing me that not only do you need to buy a pass, not a single ticket, but the passes are cash only. GREAT. I'm purchasing the suspect 48 hour pass on my phone...as the bus comes and leaves. We wait around with other confused tourists who didn't get their shit together in time either. I get on the bus and the lady tells me they don't accept the pass on my phone? I ask what did I just buy then? She says I can show my phone to the Niagara Falls bus kiosk to get a pass. Seems backwards and I could go on but I'm complained enough to you all, but ok. We're on the bus and get the pass. Later I learned not only is there no single ride fare, there's no 24 hour pass, only the 48 hour pass...\n\nFinally at the Falls, it's breathtaking! I see my sad American-side comrades on the other side of the river and feel bad they're not getting the view we're getting. We get our tourist pics and ooh and aww. We do Journey Behind the Falls which is neat and we wait for people to take 3 minute video of rushing water in a cave they will never look at again until we can look. Hungry for lunch and (rightfully) warned not to eat at Clifton Hill, we take a bus up and to the Flying Saucer diner (which was tasty). Now we have a conundrum: We definitely want to go on the Hornblower but are worried about timing to do anything else being at the mercy of bus and train schedules. So we go on the Hornblower which was WILD. Holy shit I have never done something so 0 to 100. This wasn't mist it was a rainstorm. I'm convinced the boat took us closer than they normally do. Ponchos barely kept our torsos dry. We were in soaked sneakers for another 6 hours which I spent wondering why they don't have a giant heater for folks to use after. I'd pay money to feel dry. I could go on about my money making idea around this. Now we're stuck. We feel we don't have enough time to take a bus, enjoy another experience, then take a bus back and up to the train station. We would've rushed through Ripley's Museum so instead we aimlessly wandered around the tacky Clifton Hill. With little choice, we split a Wendy's meal and eat it by the Falls which is brilliantly lit up for the night, which is beautiful and kind of funny because we're eating fast food. As we walk to our bus stop we see our bus pass us, and it's then an anxiety ridden and stressful long wait for the last bus that gets us to our train just in time.\n\nDay 4:\n\n* Culinary Adventure Co food tour\n* Jimmy's coffee\n* Art Gallery of Toronto\n* Darvish Persian Restaurant\n\nOur feet were seriously killing us by day 5. My husband had 4 blisters on top of his other foot problems I'll spare you the details of, but we powered through the Kensington Market + Chinatown walking food tour with Culinary Adventure Co. that was recommended here, which I also highly recommend! Our guides were lovely and the food varied and delicious while learning about the area. We took a break at Jimmy's Coffee then head to the Art Gallery of Toronto. (Why is there a framed portrait of My Little Pony Artwork...?) We were bamboozled into walking up the spiral staircase and warned people it wasn't worth it on our way down. We love trying new food and had never ate Persian before, so we chose Darvish and were not disappointed! We rested our weary bones in the hotel hot tub again that night.\n\nDay 5:\n\n* Frans breakfast\n* Royal Ontario Museum\n* Dimmi Bar &amp; Trattoria\n* Dessert Lady\n\nThis was one of my favorite days. We had a nice big breakfast at Frans then spent four hours at the Royal Ontario Museum!! I love museums so I was really looking forward to this one because of the variety of exhibits. I could've spent much longer at the gemstone exhibit because the samples were so fascinating to look at. The evolution of style exhibit was unique, but my favorite part had to be the dinosaur/extinct animals exhibit, especially the sabertooth and direwolf skeletons. We ended the night with Dimmi Bar &amp; Trattoria which had very friendly staff. Grabbed some baked goods from the Dessert Lady, then ate them back at our hotel with Cotti Coffee. We wanted to go to a comedy club show at some point, but we were simply too tired at the end of each night. Our feet were seriously in pain.\n\nDay 6:\n\n* Egg Bae\n* Explored Union Station\n* Love Park\n\nA slow morning before our evening flight home. We used our Cotti Coffee coupons for coffee then ate one of the most impressive breakfast sandwiches we've ever had at Egg Bae. We made the horrible mistake of taking an accessibility elevator down to the subway and had to hold our breath because of the multiple puddles of half-way dried pee inside. I made a mental note to clean my shoes when I got home. Since we had an awkward amount of time before having to head to the airport we spent it taking our time exploring Union Station where we grabbed some snacks for our flight then walked over to Love Park to kill time. Some good karma came our way when it was time to buy our UP Express tickets. The man in front of us only took his receipt, not his ticket, and he was long gone into the crowd by the time we confirmed it. So free ticket for us! (Didn't see a confused man later, so assumed he got on just fine, especially because the employee didn't actually look at the tickets.) Flew home and finished with the final travel stress of 5 minutes of panic where we couldn't locate our car keys (they were within a pocket in a pocket in our backpack.)\n\nFinal notes:\n\n* A LOT of cannabis stores. And dentists.\n* The streetcar system was neato until I read about the bedbugs.\n* Holy 13% sales tax Batman.\n* I love the museum variety.\n* We got by without exchanging USD for CAD, though having some would have saved us some inconveniences.\n\nHad fun Toronto!","subreddit":"toronto","comments":98,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/17eu8ya/greetings_from_massachusetts_we_visited_toronto/","_row":"Greetings from Massachusetts!

I don't like it, but I did try hard to study, and in general maintained good scores. People dislike the school system where they force feed you information, but I find the geographical, historical, science and traditional Chinese literature that I was taught very useful in understanding the world. I only need to brush up a bit or go slightly deeper than what I already know to gain a good grasp many topics, and I can still recite a good amount of information from my head. Math is still useless though. I managed to enter to top high school in my city, and then the local public University.\n\nI was bullied at school, but simply because I am Waishengren. There wasn't really a sense of \"competition\" I could remember, because for the most part we were studying for the universal college exam, not GPA. I was nowhere near the top of the class, but that wasn't really ever a source of pressure for me, as I know I won't be competing against those ahead of me anyways.\n\nI started out work doing 30K a month, and climbed my way up to 90K+. That's partly because my company was bought out by an American company, yes, but I didn't actually feel too much of the \"Taiwanese working culture\" either before or after. I had reasonable workloads and reasonable deadlines, the colleagues weren't close but were friendly, and everyone worked well together professionally. I don't doubt there are good working conditions and there are bad ones, but it's not universally one way or the other, and it's not like you're entirely powerless in the system -- quitting and finding a new place is always an option.\n\nIt's damp and humid, yes, but the same can be said for a lot of other places. FWIW, Japanese summers aren't that much better and you're stuck in a suit. At least Taiwan *has* a winter, and (global warming permitting) usually lasts 5\\~6 months. People everywhere is a good thing in my books. This means that you get a larger selection of food and goods on the street, and certain types of public transport can be sustained. The traffic is not the best, but not the worst either. I don't own a car or motorcycle, so I'm fully pedestrian most of the time, and I don't really feel too threatened.\n\nAs for Taiwanese friendliness, I guess this is up to individual preconceptions. All I can say is that Taiwanese people tend to show their true colors in an interaction, unlike the Japanese who are always behind a mask. But Taiwanese are also being true without being rude or blunt, unlike Americans. It's a middle ground I'm pretty satisfied with.\n\nOne key point of Taiwanese culture (which is similar across many parts of Asia, as I've learned) , is the tacit recognition of certain principles that should be given and received reciprocally. In other words, yes, it is very social norm based. If you understand the norms and perform according to it, you'll be fine. If you step out of bounds, you will receive a harsh judgement. Foreigners are usually given a lax treatment in this regard, and while it may appear as friendly, it could also appear as exclusion or isolation.\n\nIn the end, people need to remember that Taiwan is *still* a homogenous society, with comparatively little societal shaping input from other cultures, and actively avoids them. Taiwanese will generally view their own island positively, because *of course* they're familiar with how everything works, both on the surface and below. And there had always been a push from within to change things that aren't satisfactory.\n\nSo, as a Taiwanese, I like this amazing island.

Michael McCaul and Rep. Jake Ellzey, have expressed their opposition to several grant applications submitted to the Federal Railroad Administration. These grant applications were jointly submitted by Amtrak and Texas Central, two companies aiming to partner to establish a 240 high-speed rail line between Houston and Dallas.\n\nTexas Central Railroad and Amtrak submitted three grant applications and a corridor identification program application focusing on rail infrastructure and intercity passenger rail.\n\nThe concerns raised by Congressman McCaul and Ellzey were disclosed in a letter addressed to Amit Bose, Administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration, and were initially reported by The Bond Buyer, a publication specializing in municipal bonds. The primary issues they raised revolve around the potential use of taxpayer funds to support a project led by a private company, as well as concerns related to property rights and other related matters.\n\nIn their letter, addressed to both the Federal Railroad Administration and the U.S. Department of Transportation, the congressmen emphasized the importance of safeguarding landowners\u0019 rights, particularly in the context of what they perceive as an unrealistic and financially unviable rail project.\n\n\n\u001cIf approved, these applications will result in taxpayer money being used by a private company to take private land from landowners through eminent domain. Landowners deserve to have their land rights protected against the unrealistic and financially infeasible rail project proposed to be funded through these applications,\u001d the letter stated.\n\nRepresentatives McCaul and Ellzey also highlighted that the project has significant opposition from rural landowners and local governments along its proposed route.\n\n\u001cBy partnering with Texas Central, organized as a private limited liability corporation, Amtrak will funnel federal taxpayer money to a private corporation for what was initially proposed as an exclusively privately funded venture. The project has received fierce pushback from rural landowners as well as county and local governments along the proposed route,\u001d the letter added.\n\nIn their letter, the congressmen also brought attention to the project\u0019s heavy reliance on a train exclusively manufactured in Japan. Additionally, they noted the unique track system proposed for this project is incompatible with the existing U.S. rail infrastructure.\n\n\n\u001cSince 2009, when the project was first proposed, Texas Central has secured very few parcels of property and is attempting to acquire private property using eminent domain. It will exclusively run a type of train manufactured only in Japan using a unique track that is incompatible with any existing system in the United States,\u001d the letter said.","subreddit":"fuckcars","comments":37,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/16zx3na/two_texas_congressmen_oppose_highspeed_rail/","_row":"Two Texas Congressmen oppose high-speed rail grants, urge FRA to reject"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-24","timestamp":1695561227,"title":"Bus driving through Patricks Street, Cork during the car free hours yesterday.

[Fantasy, LitRPG] - Chapter 224 (Book 6 Chapter 9)","text":"**Two Days Later**\n\nThe teleportation energies faded around them.\n\nRob stumbled for a moment, yet only a moment. He was well-accustomed to the aftereffects of teleportation magic. His allies...less so. A cacophony of unhappy groans serenaded him, and several pairs of eyes glared at him accusingly, as if asking why *he* was never affected too badly by this.\n\n*Sorry, but as a good friend once said \u0013 I'm just built different.* Rob put on an apologetic grin as he stepped past Riardin's Rangers, Diplomacy, the Elders, Seneschal Sylpeiros, Overseer Nelrith, and a handful of coalition soldiers, all who were still recovering. A Fiend messenger was waiting at the other end of the teleportation chamber, watching the sight with open-mouthed stupefaction.\n\n\"Deadlands Squad, reporting for duty,\" Rob said, saluting her. \"Can you bring us to wherever the Overseers are? Kind of on a time crunch here.\"\n\nThe messenger's eyes shimmered with the telltale sign of Identify. Her mouth somehow dropped further.\n\nRob snapped his fingers in front of her face. \"Mmhmm, Level 92, very impressive, I get it. Where are the Overseers?\"\n\nShe jumped an inch into the air. \"Yes! Of course...Rob...*King* Rob?\"\n\nHis face wrinkled with disgust, as if someone had waved rotten meat under his nose. \"Absolutely not. Just the name is fine.\" While saying yes probably would've helped solidify his position, the notion of people calling him lofty titles filled him with deep-seated revulsion. He wasn't a King, or an Overseer, or a Seneschal, or a Warden. 'Leader' was merely a tool he employed to make people listen. 'Lord' was about the most he was willing to roll with, and even that didn't really pass the smell test.\n\nNone of them were *him*. Rob was Rob.\n\n...Although 'Blightkiller' had been cool. He would accept that one if people used it. It was by far the title he'd earned the most.\n\nOnce everyone got back on their feet, the messenger quickly led them through a series of empty hallways. Sylpeiros and the non-Fiend coalition soldiers were gazing every which way, on high alert, seeming to expect soul-munching horrors to emerge from the shadows at any moment.\n\nRob almost chuckled at the looks on their faces \u0013 before remembering that the Fiends had tried assassinating Riardin's Rangers more often than any other race. Everything was cool *now*, but only after the Deserters paved the way for reconciliation. He wouldn't blame the newbies for being a tad nervous.\n\nIt didn't take long to reach the Overseers' conference room. Which, in reality, was a repurposed mess hall with some bells and whistles slapped on for vanity's sake. They'd set up shop as closely as possible to the teleportation chamber. \"Here we are,\" the messenger said, stepping aside and gesturing to a pair of scuffed double doors. \"The Overseers await within.\"\n\nThe coalition soldiers stayed outside, while pretty much everyone else entered. Rob, Sylpeiros, and Overseer Nelrith went in because they were high-ranking officials. Riardin's Rangers went in because they were part of Rob's entourage. The Elders went in because no one wanted to tell them no. Diplomacy went in because no one *could* tell them no without having the word somehow twisted around into a confession of their innermost secrets.\n\nRob was greeted by a nostalgic sight as he stepped inside: a group of Fiends, seated at the opposite end of a table, trying their best to look imposing. All it needed was Overseer Nelrith to complete the set \u0013 and there she went, heading over to join her compatriots. \"It's been some time,\" she said, her shoulders dropping, as if releasing a long-held tension.\n\n\"Indeed.\" One of the Overseers gave her a welcoming nod. \"It is heartening to see that you have returned alive and well, Nelrith.\" He turned to face Rob. \"As have you. The journey south was more perilous than any of us anticipated, but from what we've heard, our coalition prevailed nonetheless. Elatra is now safe from the Blighted Leader who sought to bring ruination to our lands.\"\n\nRob didn't know how to respond to that. It felt a little disarming to hear the last few months of his life condensed so succinctly. Like all the battles, death, strife, pain, and skin-of-their-teeth moments had only been worth one paragraph in a newspaper article depicting some far-off conflict. Then again, that was how Fiendland experienced the Harpy war \u0013 through sporadic letters sent by teleportation mages to keep their homeland apprised of the situation.\n\n*Do they understand how dire it truly was?* he wondered. *And how much worse it nearly became?* Overseer Nelrith knew, but that was because she'd lived it. He couldn't expect the others to treat it with the same weight he did.\n\nThat went triple for the general Fiend populace. Rob doubted that they'd known anything except for the bare minimum needed to explain why 'Roy' wasn't coming back for a while. Informing them of a potential Blight invasion would've accomplished nothing \u0013 besides inciting a panic, anyway.\n\n*Guess that's just how it is.* Wasn't a *bad* thing, really. Elnaril fading into obscurity outside of his home territory was exactly the legacy that sadistic prick deserved.\n\n\"I think we did alright for our first diplomatic trip,\" Rob said, taking a seat across from the Overseers. \"They're not all like that, I hope.\"\n\n\"No,\" Sylpeiros grunted. \"I've attended many, and none have resulted in spearheading a reckless charge into the heart of enemy territory. None until *you* got involved.\"\n\nRob gave him two thumbs-up. \"Glad to keep things interesting.\" He glanced at the Overseers. \"So did you\u0013\"\n\n\"We've followed your instructions,\" Overseer #2 affirmed. \"The teleportation mages who previously transported you to the Elven Village have been accruing mana for some time now. They will be ready tomorrow at the latest. We have also gathered food and supplies for your journey, including Anti-Corruption Amulets and some Hazmat Suits.\" He paused. \"Do you...sincerely intend to venture into the Deadlands?\"\n\n\"Yeah, we do. Thanks for the help...uh...\"\n\nRob trailed off. Overseer #2 frowned, then let out a scandalized squawk. \"Did you just cast Identify on me?\" the Fiend queried, aghast.\n\n\"Maybe.\" Rob scratched the back of his head. \"I'm doing my best to remember people's names these days, but it's work-in-progress.\"\n\nThe Overseer \u0013 named Varghan, *apparently* \u0013 looked like he wanted to leave the room and take a long nap. \"This from the man who calls himself our Leader.\"\n\nWith those words, the temperature in the room seemed to drop by several degrees. \"Is that going to be a problem?\" Rob asked, in an excessively casual tone. Diplomacy had warned him that there might be pushback when he returned to Fiend territory. Authority figures never gave up influence without a fight, and even though Rob was Level 92 and a famous hero in their society, he was still a Human. At worst, the Overseers may have run a smear campaign sabotaging his public image while he was stuck dealing with Elnaril.\n\n\"This is a complicated dilemma,\" Nelrith began, preempting the argument that was about to burst forth. \"No one can deny that you are a pillar of Fiend territory. In the months since we first met, you've already saved us thrice over. The Corruption plague, Titan's Fist, and Elnaril were all calamities averted by your efforts.\"\n\nShe paused. \"And if I am to be blunt; we could not oppose you if you pressed the matter. Riardin's Rangers would burn half our territory to the ground before we stopped you. *If* we stopped you.\"\n\n\"Oh brother.\" Rob rolled his eyes. \"Do you people always have to be so dramatic? No territories are getting burnt down, promise. I'm here to work *with* you guys, not lord over people like a tyrant. Me being Leader helps you as well \u0013 Fiend territory is going to be participating in international negotiations moving forward, and having the strongest Combat Class user in the world as your representative will count for a lot.\"\n\n\"We know the benefits,\" Varghan muttered. \"But...you do realize that this has never happened before, yes? Members of one race cannot become the Leader of a different territory. It simply isn't done.\"\n\n\"How would you know that? Fiend territory has been isolated until now. For all you\u0013\"\n\n\"Actually,\" Elder Alessia interrupted, \"his assumption is correct.\"\n\nRob blinked. \"Oh. Well. What can I say? I'm a trendsetter.\"\n\nThe Overseers exchanged unreadable glances. After a few seconds, Varghan leaned forward. \"Goroth did not return with you.\"\n\n\"...No.\" Rob lowered his gaze. \"He didn't.\"\n\n\"Forgive me for broaching his death in this manner. I don't mean to imply that you are to blame for what transpired. However, it is a solemn fact that Goroth was perhaps the most stalwart supporter of Fiend territory. He trained and led people for centuries, and before Faelynn's ascent, he was considered to be our strongest fighter. Yet despite his many virtues, he still declined to take up a position of greater importance, because he realized the gravity of such a decision.\"\n\n*I think he should have,* Rob thought. It wasn't something he would say out loud to grieving Fiends, but in his eyes, Goroth had sort of wasted his potential. Elatra needed more people in power with that much honesty and moral fiber. And while the Overseers were dressing up Goroth's reluctance in pretty words, Rob disagreed with that assessment as well. Rather than Goroth having carefully considered all angles, what it really boiled down to was that he just...hadn't wanted to lead. He'd preferred it when someone else made the final call.\n\nRob would never condemn that sentiment. Leadership wasn't necessarily some higher calling everyone should aspire to. But if he personally had to choose between following or leading? He would...do both, actually. Follow credible advice from people he trusted, and lead Elatra back down the right path when it inevitably tried to get all war-crime-y again.\n\n\"Let me finish what you're about to say,\" he cut in. \"You're worried that, compared to Goroth \u0013 who already thought he wasn't worthy \u0013 I don't measure up. I'm less experienced and less loyal. The only thing I have on him is Levels, which as our darling Queen Ragnavi has so plainly shown, does *not* automatically make for a good Leader.\"\n\nRob shook his head. \"The thing is, experience is something that's solved with time. Teach me, and I'll learn. Loyalty is a different matter, but if you ask me, it's honestly better that I'm not quite as loyal as Goroth. He probably would've been ride-or-die for you guys even if Fiend territory was in the wrong. With me, we'll keep each other honest.\"\n\n\"That would still mean that our Leader is a Human,\" Varghan pointed out.\n\n\"A human of Earth, yes. Not Elatra. I don't come with any of the baggage or hangups that a native here would. To me, Fiends are the same as any other race.\"\n\n\"Earth...from what we understand, you wish to return to your home world one day.\"\n\n\"I do and I will. Unfortunately, I'm also planning to commute back and forth.\" Rob let out an aggrieved sigh. \"Alas, I've made friends here and found someone I love, so now I'm invested in this dumpster fire of a world. You can trust me to stick around and strive for a brighter future.\" *And like hell I'm quitting after putting in so much work. Gonna take my sunk cost straight to the bank.*\n\nOverseer Varghan hesitated, struggling with what to say. He seemed to be preparing a rebuttal when Nelrith shook her head. Then, all at once, the fight went out of him. \"Just tell me this,\" he said, in a near-whisper, as if speaking to a funeral casket. \"Did Goroth die well?\"\n\nThe question hit Rob like a freight train. While he was stunned, Orn'tol immediately stepped forward, the boy loudly raising his voice. \"Goroth saved my life. He...\" Orn'tol swallowed a lump in his throat, and when he continued speaking, his voice quavered with the guilt of a survivor. \"I wish I could've thanked him.\"\n\nVarghan looked from Orn'tol to Rob. \"Trust,\" he murmured. \"An endorsement. The highest kind possible.\"\n\nHe looked to Faelynn \u0013 the Fiend who'd spent the most time around Rob. \"You would put your faith in him?\"\n\n\"Unequivocally,\" she replied, without missing a beat.\n\nThat seemed to remove the last of his doubt. Varghan nodded, then stood up. \"Very well. If any here oppose Rob the Human's status as Leader, now is the time to make your peace.\"\n\nNone did.\n\nDiplomacy clapped their hands together. \"Excellent! I congratulate you on achieving the rare compromise where both parties *aren't* left unhappy. Although, I would recommend reversing whatever forms of political sabotage you were implementing against Rob. Might get awkward when you announce he's the new Leader.\"\n\n\"Sabotage?\" Varghan barked out an incredulous laugh. \"As if we could. The Gods' Edict practically declared him to be the savior of the world \u0013 and more importantly, do you have any notion of how much our coffers are being bolstered by profiting from his image? Theater plays, wooden carvings, autograph replicas, painted portraits...Argath preserve, it's like conjuring money from thin air.\"\n\nRob raised a finger aloft. \"Okay, that's my first official policy as Leader. I want a piece of that cash cow. A *fair* piece, so don't go complaining. If I had to deal with half the goddamn country getting my name wrong, I deserve to get paid for it.\"\n\nThe Overseers collectively froze. \"You were never reimbursed?\" Nelrith sounded like he'd just told her that the moon was made of cheese. \"I did think it strange when you once paid a vendor in HP Potions, but...no, that's impossible. Varghan should've been responsible for handling those affairs.\"\n\n\"*What?!* I most certainly was not.\" He pointed to a different Overseer. \"She was in charge, I assure you.\"\n\nIn the end, each Overseer blamed another for the Party's financial standing. Faelynn was the only one with a salary, and that was just a holdover from her time as a Fiend soldier. No one in the room was more baffled than Diplomacy, who, after examining the Overseers with widened eyes, declared that they were somehow all telling the truth.\n\nA small part of Rob wanted to be exasperated. A larger part of him thought that this was the funniest thing he'd ever seen \u0013 and that it would give him extra leverage moving forward.\n\n\"I must say,\" Sylpeiros suddenly remarked. \"This is different from what I expected.\"\n\nNelrith glared at him. \"And what *were* you expecting? Ritual blood sacrifices? A buffet consisting of the finest souls? You've traveled and fought with my people for months now, Seneschal. You know we aren't the ravenous beasts that other territories have painted us as.\"\n\n\"To know is different than to experience.\" He swept his gaze across the room, contemplating something. \"How many of your people have learned to speak Common?\"\n\n\"More each day. The process is slow, as rushing it can lead to grievous bodily harm.\" She grimaced. \"It would be easier if your people learned our language, but as every other race speaks Common, we recognize that the onus for communication largely rests on our shoulders.\"\n\nSylpeiros raised an eyebrow. \"Learning to speak a language can cause grievous bodily harm?\"\n\n\"I'll explain later,\" Rob said. He'd forgotten to mention that bit when giving his lecture on why the gods were assholes. Fiends learning to speak Common, or non-Fiends learning to speak Fiendish, could literally kill someone if done too quickly. It was one of the restrictions the gods had put in place to foster conflict between races. Without Rob recognizing Fiendish as Spanish \u0013 and without the gods being plagiarizing hacks \u0013 the language barrier would've likely never been breached.\n\nAfter a moment, Sylpeiros shrugged in acceptance, turning to face the Overseers. \"You'll be delighted to know that I have judged your people,\" he said, in a lofty tone, \"and have concluded that you are perfectly boring. I can't believe that a Leader's ascension was resolved without at least one person being beaten into the ground. My routine negotiations with Ragnavi were more fraught with tension than this.\"\n\nHe smirked, and for once, there even seemed to be some contentment in it. \"I have no issue with extending our alliance beyond the necessity of our current troubles.\"\n\n\"How kind of you,\" Nelrith drawled. \"Shall we discuss details, then?\"\n\nRob suppressed a grumble as they got down to brass tacks. *Second official policy: I'm hiring someone to attend long-winded meetings for me.*\n\n\\--\n\nMercifully, their talk didn't last much longer than that. The Overseers codified Fiendland's alliance with Sylpeiros, and some additional measures for the Deadlands Tour were mentioned, such as Fiendland using Dwarven-made radios \u0013 delivered from Spatial Storage \u0013 to keep in touch while the Tour was underway. Nerasi had been reluctant to part with the devices, yet they were too useful to hoard in times of need.\n\nAnother idea that Rob suggested was to utilize the city-wide barrier that the Fiends had created in Broadwater. Back then, it was strong enough to keep out a grown Blight for weeks straight. He'd hoped they might have improved upon the spell since, but according to the Overseers, the barrier's limitations remained the same. It was still stationary, and it still required over fifty Fiends using Soul Burn to form. That made it largely impractical for anything besides fortifying defenses in one location...and at a very great cost.\n\nIn a way, the Fiends' barrier highlighted how absurd Purge Corruption and Vul'to's Soul Barrier were. Those Skills could destroy and repel the Blight, respectively, with no detriment to their user. For others to perform an equivalent feat, numerous people needed to forfeit their own lives, converting life essence into raw mana to achieve what Rob and Vul'to could do whenever they pleased.\n\nAlthough when viewed from the opposite perspective, Soul Burn seemed just as absurd. Purge Corruption was a unique Skill granted by *the* Skills themselves. They'd never figured out Vul'to's deal, but for all they knew, he was a product of the Skills' intervention as well. Neither of their abilities or Sub-Classes were ever meant to exist \u0013 yet Soul Burn could replicate and surpass them. When fifty Fiends used Soul Burn, they could make a barrier with enough strength to forestall the Blight. When a thousand people used Soul Burn, they could make a spell capable of vanquishing a Blight in one explosive blast.\n\nWhen an entire race used Soul Burn, they could make a Cataclysm.\n\nSo, yeah, no Fiend barrier. Purge Corruption and strength of arms would have to suffice.\n\nThe Overseers ended the meeting by asking Rob to give a speech to the public, where he would assuage their fears and announce his rise to the station of Leader. Rob objected on the grounds that giving canned speeches was a miserable experience that made him feel like a used car salesman. They settled on him writing an inspiring message that would be propagated throughout the territory via letters and Message Crystals.\n\nOne of the Overseers suggested holding onto some letters, then selling them later as 'collector's items' once interest was drummed up. In spite of the Overseers' many conspiracies and political schemes, Rob had never felt like he'd made a deal with the devil until he watched them invent scalping in real-time.\n\nAfter that, it was just a matter of waiting. The teleportation mages would be ready tomorrow morning. Riardin's Rangers considered taking a stroll through Acrastor City to keep themselves occupied, but decided against it. They didn't want to grow accustomed to being back in what was essentially their home \u0013 only to set off on another life-threatening journey the very next day.\n\nRob did, however, make one pit stop to visit an old friend...acquaintance...*coworker*, that is.\n\n\"Urian!\" He grinned wide as he stepped into the Artificer's workshop. \"Haven't seen you in months! How's\u0013\"\n\nA blur rushed at him. His hand snapped out, catching the projectile before it could smack him in the forehead. \"Hello to you too,\" Rob muttered, glancing at the compass held safely in his palm. \"You're lucky I didn't attack whatever this is out of reflex. Not the smartest...\"\n\nHis voice failed him as he turned his gaze towards Urian's workshop. The place was in even more chaotic disarray than usual, as if a horde of rampaging gorebeasts had plowed through without a care. Papers were scattered across the floor, scorch marks peppered the walls, and a liquid that looked suspiciously like acid was dripping from a hole in the ceiling.\n\nThen there was Urian himself. The aged Elf sported dark circles under his eyes and unkempt hair that stood on end. He'd also never looked prouder than this very moment. \"It. Is. *Done*.\"\n\nRob peered at the compass and cast Identify.\n\n**Name:** Compass of Corruptive Tracking  \n**Description:** This Enchanted Item always points to the nearest Dungeon. Its range is limitless. It cannot be broken or damaged outside of exceptional means. Holding it slightly accentuates the taste of sugar.\n\n\"...Sugar?\" Rob started with.\n\n\"*That's* what you're focused on? Bah.\" Urian flopped back into a chair, sighing. \"If you must know, this compass was originally a minor Enchanted amulet that I reforged into the Item you see now.\"\n\nRob examined the compass in more detail. It didn't appear to be perfectly circular, as if it had been hammered into shape by hand, and the internal needle was made of carved wood. He slowly moved the device from side to side, eyebrows raising when the needle stayed stubbornly pointed at somewhere out in the southwest. \"Why not just use a real compass as a base?\"\n\n\"Artificers are slaves to our Inspiration,\" Urian explained, sounding oddly chipper. \"Hesitating when the feeling strikes \u0013 no matter how it strikes \u0013 means losing an opportunity. When I witnessed that plume of Corruption erupting from the Deadlands, like a fetid spear of miasma, it *spoke* to me. My Inspiration bade me to craft this Enchanted Item as such, and so I did.\"\n\nHe yawned, stretching wearied arms, and then closed his eyes. \"That compass is unique. There is no Enchanted Item of its like anywhere else in the world. Which, I might add, makes this the third Item effect I have created wholesale from nothing in the span of a year. Do not expect another for a very, very long time.\"\n\nRob idly tapped his finger on the compass. Admittedly, he would've preferred a mega death ray to kill Blights from afar, but that was *probably* asking for too much. Besides; Urian had a stellar track record when it came to forging Enchanted Items that wound up more useful than anticipated. He'd created the Amulet of Allocation, meant to allow Party members to share passive bonuses, which ended up also allowing Rob to share Fast Learner. He'd upgraded the Ring of Waterbreathing months before it became vital to entering Merfolk territory. He'd made the Ring of Disguise so Vul'to could hide his new Fiend body, only for Vul'to to reject it, and for the Item to help Diplomacy to live a semi-normal life.\n\nThis compass may not be a death ray, but it would likely come in handy in unexpected ways. Nodding, Rob stowed the Enchanted Item in Spatial Storage. \"Thank you,\" he said, infusing his voice with genuine gratitude. \"Your work has been crucial towards...a lot of things, honestly. We would've been screwed six ways to Sunday without all those Enchanted Items and Firebombs and Potions. I just want you to know that you've made a positive difference in this world. People are alive as a result of your efforts.\"\n\nUrian responded with a loud snore.\n\n*Of course.* Rob exited the room, gently shutting the door behind him to not wake the Artificer from his beauty sleep. *Urian, Hauz, Malika, Diplomacy...why do I know so many headstrong savants? Jason and Keira too, if I'm including physical savants. Is it me? Is there something about me that attracts weirdos?*\n\nHe was glad that no one was around to answer that question.\n\n\\--\n\nTomorrow came in the blink of an eye.\n\nThe Deadlands Squad stood ready as the teleportation mages prepared to transport everyone south. They'd gathered their supplies, their resolve, and their wits. The rest would come down to providence \u0013 and a proper application of heavy explosives.\n\nMana began to coalesce around them. In that moment, Rob felt overcome by a strange sensation he couldn't quite place. Something like...bitter wistfulness? Or maybe it was closer to a premonition.\n\nLike an insistent notion that this would be the last time he saw Fiend territory.\n\nHe wasn't sure why. This was hardly the first instance of Riardin's Rangers heading off into certain danger. They'd nearly been killed by Blights, in, what, six territories now? The Deadlands wasn't special just because it happened to be Elatra's version of New Jersey. A little poisonous air and hostile creatures never hurt anybody.\n\nRob told himself that, expecting the premonition to fade. It didn't. The sensation blossomed into full-blown paranoia, the kind that had warned him of mortal peril on far too many occasions.\n\nIt was right more often than not.\n\n*Oh well,* Rob thought, with a mental shrug. Wasn't like he could turn back even if he wanted to. And if his gut was telling him that he was making a mistake?\n\nHe would just have to prove it wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore chapters are available on [**Patreon**](https://www.patreon.com/kamikazepotato).\n\nThere's also a [Discord ](https://discord.gg/4CJaweHnqX)now for all my stories.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n\\--\n\n[Next Chapter](https://new.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/16xmnzb/an_outcast_in_another_world_subtitle_is_insanity/)","subreddit":"HFY","comments":15,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/16u5xiw/an_outcast_in_another_world_subtitle_is_insanity/","_row":"An Outcast In Another World (Subtitle: Is 'Insanity' A Racial Trait?)

I was in the midst of mine a few years back, when I was a junior in college.\n \nThere\u0019s nothing particularly dramatic about it. I had no interest in romance in my teens when plenty of people around me were going through such formative experiences. I hardly socialized, either. So, unsurprisingly, when I finally acted on the feelings I started to have towards certain members of the opposite sex, I was clumsy and awkward, and I met with no success.\n \nI recognize that it wasn\u0019t too big of a deal in the grand scheme of things, even if it felt catastrophic to me at the time. I was downcast but not self-pitying. I realized that I had a lot of personal growth ahead of me before I\u0019d have much to offer to another person, and I felt a little lonely and insecure as a result.\n \nThat insecurity didn\u0019t stop me from opting for a semester abroad. It\u0019s something I\u0019d always seen as a valuable learning opportunity, and, thanks to my school\u0019s strong ties with a Danish educational program, I soon found myself on a plane from the states to Copenhagen.\n \nThe first couple weeks went smoothly enough. I explored plenty of landmarks, from ascending the Round Tower\u0019s iconic helical corridor to touring the gigantic Frederiksborg Castle.\n \nI also made progress in a basic-level Danish language course. Learning the language in detail was hardly necessary, though, as virtually every resident there would rather practice their English than try to decipher a foreigner\u0019s rudimentary Danish.\n \nI first saw her at a crowded bar on a Saturday night. My roommate and I were sipping Carlsbergs when I spotted a woman by the door. She had red hair and pale skin, and there was a peculiar, kinetic energy about her that caused her to stand out from the crowd. For a moment, we made eye contact before, nervously, I averted my gaze to the floor.\n \nMy roommate announced that he was turning in for the night. No sooner did he leave than she approached me. When I started mumbling a basic greeting in Danish, she smiled and quickly cut me off.\n \n\u001cI saw you looking at me. Want to buy me a drink?\u001d Like many Danes, she spoke fluent English with a Nordic accent.\n \n\u001cUh, yeah, sure,\u001d I said, gesturing for another beer on tap.\n \nShe introduced herself as Madeline and, at her suggestion, we got ourselves a small table.\n \nShe asked me a lot of questions, and she seemed to listen intently to my responses. We talked at first about basic subjects, such as my hometown and my reasons for studying abroad, and how she\u0019d grown up nearby but recently returned from traveling through Switzerland and Germany.\n \nBefore long, we were discussing more personal topics. I explained how my father had passed when I was little, and she shared how she\u0019d recently broken up with a longtime boyfriend.\n \nAs our conversation stretched into the early morning, I realized that I felt more comfortable around her than I did around, well, just about anybody else. I found her extremely attractive, too, which contributed to my excitement.\n \nEventually, she suggested that we depart. \u001cYou going to drink that?\u001d I asked, motioning to the still-full beer I\u0019d ordered for her.\n \n\u001cNo,\u001d she laughed. \u001cI don\u0019t really drink. I just wanted to see if you\u0019d order it for me. Help yourself to it, if you want.\u001d\n \nI took a deep gulp from it as I left payment on the table before following her to the deserted cobblestone street outside. She learned into me until her face was just inches from mine. \u001cYou ever kissed a girl before?\u001d she whispered.\n \n\u001cYeah,\u001d I lied, embarrassed over my inexperience.\n \n\u001cEver done more than that?\u001d\n \n\u001cUh-huh.\u001d The smirk on her face showed me that she likely didn\u0019t believe me. \u001cJust a little,\u001d I added.\n \nIf she sensed I was lying, it didn\u0019t seem to bother her. \u001cWhat do you say,\u001d she said, drawing away from me, \u001cyou hang out with me tomorrow night? I\u0019m having a gathering with some friends and family. Afterwards, we can spend some time together alone. Just the two of us.\u001d The wink she gave me made my heart flutter.\n \n\u001cOh, yeah, okay,\u001d I stammered, nervously. \u001cSure, I\u0019ll be there.\u001d\n \nThat seemed to please her. She proceeded to describe the route I would need to take to get there. I typed each step into my travel flip phone. \n \nAs we parted ways, she called to me, \u001cVi ses senere.\u001d Danish for *see you later*.\n \nI practically skipped with joy as I made my way home. After so many self-doubts and restless nights, a charming, gorgeous woman had shown interest in *me*, of all people.\n \nMy mind flooded with thoughts of what was to follow. Maybe the event would be awkward and little would come of it. Perhaps I\u0019d say or do something foolish like I had so many times before, and I\u0019d never hear from her again. But, just maybe, this could be the start of something meaningful, or, at a minimum, something validating and fun.\n \nWhen I got home, I realized that she\u0019d left me with relatively little specific information. Madeline hadn\u0019t given me her last name or even her phone number. I had an address, but I had no idea what sort of building I was looking for, or the kind of neighborhood I\u0019d be heading into.\n \nHer mention of \u0018family\u0019 struck me as strange, too. Who brings someone to a family event on a first (or, if last night counted, second) date?\n \nMy mind didn\u0019t dwell on these peculiarities for long. Instead, I replayed the wink she gave me when she\u0019d referenced us being alone together. It was more than enough to silence any uncertainties.\n \nI spent the next morning preparing. I showered, shaved my face, and picked out a nice shirt. I tried to think in advance of the questions her friends and family members might ask me and practiced my responses before a mirror. My roommate, sensing my purpose, wished me luck as I stepped outside.\n \nAt first, the journey was unremarkable. The metro station had its usual glossy, spotless appearance. When the fully-automated train arrived, I took a seat near a chatty group of teens, and numerous passengers embarked and departed over the next few stops.\n \nThings started to change when I reached the Nørreport station. According to Madeline\u0019s instructions, I needed to switch to a train on the \u0018silver\u0019 line. However, I couldn\u0019t find a platform for such a line, nor did one appear on any of the maps throughout the station.\n \nI spotted two metro employees and asked them for assistance. They exchanged a quick glance when I mentioned the silver line.\n \n\u001cAre you sure you want to go there?\u001d asked the first.\n \nI nodded, trying to make sense of their grim, concerned expressions. \n \n\u001cThen follow me,\u001d ordered the other, a short, well-built woman with a gray ponytail.\n \nShe led me up a small staircase that I otherwise would have assumed connected to a custodial closet or maintenance hatch. At the top, she led me down a shadowy corridor. In contrast to the polished, pristine look of the rest of the station, the walls and flooring in this area were rugged and dirty.\n \nWe stepped into a cavernous room. A weak, flickering overhead light partially illuminated an empty train platform in its center. A large sign above it read *Sølv/Silver*.\n \nIn contrast to the other platforms, there appeared to be no ticket booth or electronic indicator of when the next train would arrive. When I asked about this, I found, to my surprise, that the woman who had brought me there was already gone. I was alone.\n \nI considered leaving. This all made little sense \u0013 the absence of any silver line from the map, the platform\u0019s dingy appearance, and the reaction of the employees. The air had a rancid, foul smell to it, too, and the temperature was much higher than in the rest of the station.\n \nBut, I\u0019d come this far, and it had all accorded, more or less, with the instructions Madeline had left me. I reminded myself, too, of why I was there in the first place. I thought about how comfortable and warm her presence had made me feel last night. I imagined the smile that would spread across her face when she saw me; the feeling of her lips pressed against mine; doing more than kissing, perhaps even quite a bit more.\n \nEventually, two harsh red lights punctured the opaque darkness and approached like the eyes of a hunting predator. As they grew closer, I discerned that they were the headlights to an older, shabbier train than the one I\u0019d used to get here. The smudges across its glass windows and the graffiti that covered its metal exterior reminded me much more of public transportation in the U.S. than what I\u0019d seen elsewhere in Copenhagen.\n \nEven though the train seemed to be at the end of the line, no one who had arrived on it exited. Instead, the handful of passengers in the car I stepped onto remained eerily silent as I took a seat.\n \nAn empty glass bottle rolled across its dusty floor as the train jutted back into motion, reversing direction into the black void from which it had emerged.\n \nI checked the directions Madeline had given me. Seven metro stops, and then a five block walk until I reached \u001cSkeltoftevej 27.\u001d I\u0019d be there soon enough.\n \nI tried to relax as the train sputtered along. At the first two stops, no one got on or off. By the time the train approached the third stop, I noticed a peculiar stillness among the passengers in my periphery. Neither the lanky man by the door nor the mother and daughter in matching red jackets in the seats ahead of me had moved an inch since I\u0019d gotten onboard. As far as I could tell, everyone around me remained completely motionless.\n \nI shifted my gaze to the window on my right as the train approached the third stop. Between the back-glare against the dirty glass and the outside platform\u0019s minimal lighting, I could barely make anything out.\n \nThe doors opened and, again, I discerned no movement onto or off of the train. Staring deep into the shadows outside, I noticed something else odd: the vague outlines of figures, all as still as those in my train car.\n \nAt the fourth station, I observed the same thing. I couldn\u0019t identify any details of the distant spectators, beyond that they just seemed to be standing there&doing nothing at all.\n \nIt perplexed me. Why were they there? As far as I could tell, there wasn\u0019t any other train on this track.\n \nAs the train departed, I picked up on another detail \u0013 pairs of tiny, neon green dots of light. They were hard to make out at first, but once I noticed them, I couldn\u0019t ignore them. Each hovered above the ground&right around where the obscured figures\u0019 faces would be. \n \nThe fifth and sixth stops were the same. Now that I knew to look for them, I detected no fewer than a dozen pairs of these glowing lights, all gazing at the train like eyes that never blinked.\n \nAs we approached the seventh stop, I wasn\u0019t sure what to make of what I\u0019d been seeing. The distant figures spooked me, even though I had no reason to think I was in any danger.\n \nI reflected on just how alone and isolated I was. After all, I was a foreigner traveling to an area I knew nothing about on a line that didn\u0019t appear on maps, all to see someone I\u0019d only just met. I hadn\u0019t even told anyone where I was going. \n \nBut I had to exit the train at some point, even if only to turn around. So, I mustered my courage and approached the screen doors, praying that whatever lay in the void ahead of me meant me no harm, and that I\u0019d soon be happily reunited with the gorgeous woman who\u0019d shown so much interest in me.\n \nAs the doors began to open, my hands shot impulsively to my eyes to protect them from an unexpected and intense wave of what felt like blisteringly bright light.\n \nAs my eyes started to adjust, I squinted to find before me a fully-illuminated train platform. To my relief, it was bereft of any skulking figures, or anyone at all for that matter.\n \nSounds of my footsteps echoed through the vacant train station as I made my way through it. There was nothing odd about its structure or layout, but the absence of other people left me uneasy. I remembered the giggling teens and hand-holding couples I was used to seeing at places like this. Everything around me, by contrast, felt artificial, mechanical, and joyless.\n \nThe street outside had a similarly ethereal aura to it. It possessed all the qualities of the vibrant cityscape I\u0019d spent the last few weeks exploring \u0013 cobblestone streets; occasional baroque churches; crooked houses painted in warm hues of yellow, red, and orange \u0013 but it was all quiet, so quiet, and the air carried a suffocating staleness.\n \nAs I passed by a restaurant, I found myself fixating on its chairs and tables \u0013 all uninhabited, like everything else around me. Their design, and the layout in general, were identical to that of an upscale Italian place not far from my dorm back in the states.\n \nMy mind flashed back to the night I\u0019d taken Audrie, a girl from my chemistry class, out on a date. Our conversation over the meal had been&awkward. She\u0019d acted friendly towards me earlier, but that night, she\u0019d been guarded and withholding.\n \nWhen the check arrived, I\u0019d tried to pay it in full, but she\u0019d insisted on splitting the expense. As we stepped outside, she confessed that she\u0019d thought we were hanging out as friends and hadn\u0019t realized until she\u0019d arrived at the restaurant that I\u0019d asked her on a date. \u001cI\u0019m sorry I didn\u0019t say something earlier. I just didn\u0019t know what to do.\u001d\n\nWhen she told me she didn\u0019t see me that way, I said that was okay, and I\u0019d apologized for the misunderstanding. I felt terrible, though I tried not to show it.\n \nI dismissed the memory quickly. As I continued towards Madeline\u0019s address, a distant noise caught my attention. As I got closer, I recognized it as laughter.\n \nAt first, I found this reassuring. It was the first sign of life I\u0019d encountered after traversing so much seemingly abandoned cityscape.\n \nBut, I steadily pick up on an unwelcome undertone to the shrill giggles ahead of me. There was a piercing meanness to them. They recalled the specter of a group of people \u0013 young people, by the sound of it \u0013 basking in a peer\u0019s humiliation.\n \nIt was a sound I knew too well. When I\u0019d summoned my courage to ask a classmate out to prom \u0013 a fellow violist named Maria I\u0019d shared a stand with in orchestra for over a year \u0013 she\u0019d laughed at me like that, and her friends had quickly joined in. \n \n*Do better,* I\u0019d told myself when I\u0019d cried into the mirror that night. *Nobody owes me anything.*\n \nI\u0019d do better tonight, I told myself. Everything was going to change. Madeline and I had made a connection so quickly. She really liked me, and I liked her, too. Maybe I\u0019d just grown up on the wrong continent.\n \nThe laughter got louder until, right as I reached the alley from which it seemed to have been emanating, it stopped, and there was no one there to be found.\n \n*Just keep moving,* I told myself, adding it to a list of abnormalities I fought to keep buried in the back of my mind. *I\u0019m almost there.*\n \nFinally, I reached a street sign that read *Skeltoftevej*. The first few buildings were businesses \u0013a deli that served distinctly Danish open sandwiches called smørrebrød, a barber\u0019s shop, a camera store.\n \nAt last, I found myself facing a brick structure with the number \u001827\u0019 affixed to its front door. The sign next to the entrance displayed three words: *Den Værdige Bedemand.* I knew that \u0018den\u0019 translated to \u0018the\u0019, but the remaining words were unfamiliar to me. My best guess was that it was a bar or a restaurant.\n \nIf so, it was a fancy one, judging by the black suit worn by the man by the ornate front desk inside \u0013 incidentally, the first person I\u0019d seen since the train station. I expected to feel some sense of relief at seeing another living, breathing person, but his emaciated appearance and grim expression brought me little comfort.\n \nHe said something to me in Danish \u0013 I think \u001cLan jeg hjælpe dig?\u001d (*Can I help you?*) \u0013 but he spoke a little too rapidly for me to be sure. I just stated Madeline\u0019s name, hoping he\u0019d understand that I was looking for her.\n \n\u001cMadeline,\u001d he repeated back to me. He nodded solemnly and then beckoned for me to follow him.\n \nWe arrived in a large, plain room occupied by at least two dozen people. The first thing I noticed about them was how formally they were dressed. My patterned button-down shirt looked outright casual compared to the suit jackets and plain dresses \u0013 all muted shades of black and gray \u0013 worn by everyone else.\n \nNaturally, I felt out of place. Nobody said anything to me, but I sensed, truthfully or not, that I was being judged. Why hadn\u0019t Madeline told me this was a fancy event? I wondered, too: Where was Madeline, what kind of event had she invited me to?\n \nThe absence of any food or silverware-laden tables confirmed that I was not, in fact, in a restaurant as I\u0019d inferred. Rather, the attendees were standing and chatting quietly with each other in voices no louder than a whisper. Nobody really seemed to be doing anything in particular.\n \nI approached an elderly man standing alone. \u001cExcuse me,\u001d I said meekly. \u001cI\u0019m looking for Madeline.\u001d\n \nA puzzled expression formed on his face. As he looked me over skeptically, my face turned red with a mix of nervousness and embarrassment. I felt so hopelessly lost and confused.\n \nHe slowly raised his arm and pointed towards the far end of the room. \u001cTak,\u001d I muttered before nudging my way through the small crowd in the direction he had indicated.\n \nMy jaw nearly dropped when I saw the wooden casket, which was decorated by an array of lilies and roses. Madeline lay underneath its open head panel. Her eyes were closed, and she was perfectly still. She wore the same clothes I\u0019d seen her in the previous night. A display next to the casket read, \u001cMadeline Hænning, december 12, 1994 \u0013 september 7, 2019.\u001d\n \nIt was too much to take in. My legs grew weak and I began feeling dizzy.\n \nMy mind raced to process what was happening. I was at a *funeral home*. And Madeline had invited me&to her *own* open casket?\n \nSomething else stuck out to me. Last night \u0013 when I\u0019d met Madeline \u0013 was September *14th*. One week *after* the date listed as that of her death.\n \nNone of this made sense. What was I doing here? How was any of this possible?\n \nThe old man who\u0019d directed me shuffled past me and stood next to the casket. He turned to face the rest of the crowd, which quickly grew silent.\n \nI realized he was giving some kind of speech. Was he a relative, or a priest perhaps?\n \nHe spoke in a coarse, raspy voice. My mind was too astounded for me to grasp a word of what he was saying. I wasn\u0019t even sure that it was Danish.\n \nThe reaction from the crowd baffled me even more. They were *laughing*. Again and again, the man made comments \u0013 comments that I could not understand \u0013 and the rest of the room chortled and giggled in response.\n \nAll I could do was watch, embarrassed and dumbfounded, as I wondered who tells jokes at an occasion like this.\n \nSuddenly, all eyes turned to me. \u001c*Michael*,\u001d the man hissed, somehow knowing my name. \u001cIt\u0019s time.\u001d\n \n\u001cTime & for what?\u001d I replied, exasperated. I looked around the room \u0013 at the dozens of people staring intently at me. \u001cWhat\u0019s happening? What do you want from me?\u001d\n \n\u001cIt\u0019s not us who want you,\u001d said the man. \u001cIt\u0019s her.\u001d He walked up to me, then turned to face the casket.\n \nI stood frozen as Madeline\u0019s corpse sat up. Madeline opened her eyes, and, placing both hands on the casket\u0019s mahogany surface, pulled herself slowly upward and hopped onto the floor.\n \n\u001cMichael,\u001d she said, her voice weaker and coarser than it had been last night. \u001cYou came. I knew you would.\u001d She wobbled towards me, her legs seemingly straining to support her.\n \nI froze, unable to comprehend what I was seeing. \u001cAre you, are you-\u001d I stuttered.\n \n\u001cThey\u0019re going to bury me, Michael,\u001d she said, as she continued her approach. \u001cSix feet under.\u001d\n \nAs she got closer, I recoiled at her rank, putrid smell. Impulsively, I backed up, only for the speaker to grip me tightly, holding me in place.\n \n\u001cI don\u0019t want to be alone, Michael,\u001d said Madeline. \u001cThere\u0019s room for us both down there.\u001d\n \n\u001cNo,\u001d I gasped as I struggled to get free. \u001cNo, please-\u001c\n \n\u001cThere\u0019s so much that I can show you. It\u0019ll be just the two of us, and we\u0019ll have all the time in the world. Isn\u0019t this what you always wanted? To never be alone again?\u001d\n \nShe stood right in front of me now. My stomach churned as the rotting smell grew even more pungent.\n \nThe world spun around me as panic set in. I remember tearing the man\u0019s hands off me, losing my balance, and slamming my head painfully into the casket before I hit the ground.\n \n~\n \nWhen I came to, my head was throbbing, and I was being dragged outside by two men. Graves littered the surrounding landscape.\n \nA crowd of people, including Madeline, had assembled by a deep pit a short distance away from me. Next to it was a coffin \u0013 a much larger one than I\u0019d ever seen before. Large enough for two bodies.\n \nI couldn\u0019t make sense of anything that was happening. But, I *knew*, with a sense of absolute certainty, that I was about to be buried there.\n \nI figured my best bet would be to act before they realized I was awake. Throwing all my force into it, I lunged forward, managing, barely, to pull myself free.\n \nOne of the men dived for me, grabbing my leg and sending me toppling over a headstone. As I scrambled to my feet, I noticed a long metal shovel laying atop a pile of dirt.\n \nAs one of the men charged at me, I picked up the shovel and frantically swung it. The blade slammed into his cheek, sending him sprawling.\n \n\u001cMichael, what are you doing?\u001d cried Madeline.\n \nI didn\u0019t respond. My attention was fixed on the man I\u0019d just hit. The force of the blow had somehow fractured his skin. Cracks spread over his face, which then shattered into small pieces that fell onto the ground, revealing the raw bones of his skull and a pair of unblinking, unnaturally bright green eyes.\n \nAs he got to his feet, seemingly unbothered by the evisceration of his face, my flight instinct kicked in. I remember climbing a fence and ignoring the pain in my ankle when I hit the ground on the other side. I remember the sounds of dozens of footsteps pursuing me, and being too afraid to look back. I remember Madeline\u0019s voice begging me to return.\n \nI ran on instinct, retracing my steps as best I could. Figures filled the once deserted streets around me. I ignored their missing faces and the green glow they emitted. I ignored the ones who called for me, who said they *wanted* me, who resembled Audrie, Maria, and so many others whose rejection haunted my mind every time I closed my eyes at night.\n \nBy the time I reached the platform, I was breathing rapidly and drenched in sweat. Thankfully, a train was already there.\n \nI could hear voices resounding through the station behind me. They were getting closer, louder, by the moment.\n \nI could tell that the train\u0019s doors were about to close. With my last bit of strength, I dashed forward and dove between them. Pain shot through me as my body thudded onto the hard surface inside.\n \n~\n \nWhen I awoke, my body ached all over. I was laying on a couch in some kind of office, and a woman I recognized as the employee who had led me to the silver line stood over me.\n \n\u001cDid you find what you were looking for?\u001d she asked.\n \nI was too perplexed to answer. \u001cWhat&where am I?\u001d \n \n\u001cMy office at the Nørreport station. Just upstairs from where you started.\u001d \n \n\u001cI don\u0019t understand.\u001d\n \nShe shrugged. \u001cYou do not have to. You should go home.\u001d\n \n\u001cBut&but&\u001d I stammered. \u001cWhat about the silver line, and things I saw-\u001d\n \n\u001cNobody will be riding the silver line anytime soon. Just closed down for repairs. Go home.\u001d\n \n~\n \nI\u0019ve never fully understood what happened to me that day. The metro employee refused to answer any more of my questions. I never saw her again, or any mention of a silver line even existing. Nor could I find any reference in an atlas to the part of town it had brought me to.\n \nOnce, before returning to the states, I ran into the bartender who\u0019d been on duty when I\u0019d met Madeline. When I asked him what he remembered about that night, he responded that he recalled me sitting alone, talking to myself for hours.\n \n\u001cWe did have a regular customer with that name,\u001d he\u0019d continued, after I mentioned Madeline\u0019s full name. \u001cShe told me once that we were her favorite bar in town. Haven\u0019t seen her in months, though. I have no idea what happened to her.\u001d \n \n~\n \nMy physical wounds \u0013 bruises and a sprained ankle \u0013 healed relatively quickly, but, inside, I felt shattered. I became reclusive, focusing entirely on my studies and, after graduating, on my work.\n \nA few weeks ago, my brother set me up on a date with a friend-of-a-friend who he insisted was a good fit for me. Understandably, I\u0019d spent the last few years utterly detached from the dating scene and avoiding any perceived advances. But, I eventually caved in to my brother\u0019s persistence.\n \nHer name is Clara, and, well, my brother was right. She and I formed an instant connection and, so far, we seem to be a perfect match for each other. The other night, we even exchanged a kiss, the first of my life.\n \nWe were sitting together in my apartment\u0019s living room on a rainy Saturday afternoon when I heard a knock at the door. I opened it to find a bouquet of lilies and roses sitting on the doormat.\n \n\u001cDid you order these?\u001d I asked Clara. She shook her head, her expression puzzled and concerned.\n \nA small card pinned to the bouquet displayed a short, handwritten message in black ink.\n \n*Death is the great equalizer, Michael. When it comes for you, too, know one thing: I will be waiting.*\n\n*Vi ses senere,*\n\n*Madeline.*\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeaceSim/)","subreddit":"nosleep","comments":8,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/16qx3jk/madeline/","_row":"Madeline"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-07","timestamp":1696688523,"title":"Feds Spent $3.3 Billion On Furniture During Pandemic Years While office space was shuttered and employees were paid to work from home, federal agencies kept buying furniture at more than $1 billion per year.","text":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","comments":33,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1727jru/feds_spent_33_billion_on_furniture_during/","_row":"Feds Spent $3.3 Billion On Furniture During Pandemic Years While office space was shuttered and employees were paid to work from home, federal agencies kept buying furniture at more than $1 billion per year."},{"date_utc":"2023-10-19","timestamp":1697694674,"title":"Has anyone recently experienced antisocial behaviour on Brisbane public transport that made you feel unsafe?","text":"Last night I experienced a bizarre situation on the 125 bus going through Woolloongabba along Ipswich road.

Officials say the goal is to be as climate-friendly as possible by making hydrogen through electrolysis \u0014 splitting water molecules using renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, as well as nuclear power.\r  \n\r  \nOther projects selected include the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems in California, which will produce hydrogen from renewable energy and biomass. The project is intended to provide a blueprint for decarbonizing public transportation, heavy duty trucking and port operations \u0014 key emissions drivers in the state and major sources of air pollution.\r  \n\r  \nThe Gulf Coast Hydrogen Hub will be centered in Houston, long the energy capital of the United States. The hub plans large-scale hydrogen production from both natural gas and renewables.\r  \n\r  \nThe Minnesota-based Heartland hub seeks to decarbonize fertilizer used in agriculture and advance use of clean hydrogen in electric generation and for cold climate space heating. It also plans to offer equity ownership to tribal communities and local farmers.\r  \n\r  \nThe Midwest hub in Illinois, Indiana and Michigan will use hydrogen in steel and glass production, power generation, heavy-duty transportation and sustainable aviation fuel. The hub plans to use renewable energy, natural gas and nuclear energy.\r  \n\r  \nThe Pacific Northwest hub, based in eastern Washington, will use hydropower and other renewable resources to produce clean hydrogen.\r  \n\r  \nSen.

[That it still produces losses](https://www.mot.gov.sg/news/Details/oral-reply-by-acting-minister-for-transport-chee-hong-tat-to-parliamentary-question-on-keeping-public-transport-fares-affordable) in the rail side, despite operating the cash-cow NEL, points to a policy failure.\n\nThe high use of public transport in Singapore and the recent astronomical COE prices makes it very difficult to get more people to give up their cars. Just look at all the new parents who insist they need a car to bring the little ones out on the weekends.\n\nConsequently, if there is diminishing returns from converting car owners, the LTA should shift their focus to primarily targeting public transport users.\n\nIt controls more of this experience; as central bus planner under bus contracting, it should be the LTA's job to redesign local bus networks to drive more inter-regional trips to the MRT system. Furthermore, since new lines like TEL and CRL are being built to relieve overpressure sections of the existing MRT network, MRT passengers also need a push factor to take the new lines. TEL waiting times may be that long because there's not enough passengers to use it - so if you want shorter waiting times, you should support steps taken to increase ridership.\n\nFirstly, long milk-run routes (like 51, 61, 961) are less reliable, and since waiting time is a KPI, bus operators are forced to increase travel times along these routes (which means added cost) in order to provide space to cushion the impact of traffic and meet their waiting time KPIs. We've all seen and complained about bus bunching. Breaking these long routes to reduce bus travel time should happen.\n\nSecondly, in the north and soon east, reconsider the regional relevance of the City Direct system and other similar services (850E, 951E, 982E, etc), travelling on expressways to the CBD during peak periods. Peak-period expressway congestion results in longer travel time compared to the off-peak ideal, which means bus companies, again, have to devote more resources to ensure a consistent waiting time and punctual departures. By shifting these to the MRT system, bus resources can be conserved to improve intratown and short-distance travel.\n\nThirdly, there must be consideration on beefing up local services to better connect people to new lines. It took five years to provide a DTL connection to residents of Bedok North Ave 4 with the amendment of Service 18 only done in 2022. This ignorance of MRT connections still exists, with the new [Service 163B](https://www.sbstransit.com.sg/news/introduction-of-service-163b) literally ending one stop short of Lentor MRT. This means that there is no additional capacity, or reason, for Sengkang residents to use the TEL to avoid the NEL.\n\nFourthly, travel times. Traffic congestion is not caused only by cars, it can be caused by buses too. Both have to be counted, and not just during the off-peak ideal. Bus-only systems in other cities also suffer from the same problems, and that's why Ong Teng Cheong pushed to have the MRT built. There is space to optimize the MRT service and it should be taken. Similarly, a more compact bus network can provide shorter intervals between buses using the same manpower resources. Bus passengers who don't touch the MRT, such as seniors and students travelling within a HDB town, can also benefit from this. \n\nLastly, all of us must also realize that there are other factors such as reliability and punctuality, which the MRT can do better; and as Singapore's workforce shrinks and labor costs increase, automated MRT lines are the solution to managing these costs. In contrast, new bus depots under construction even contain foreign worker dorms, indicating that the LTA foresees we will still need to import foreign bus drivers en masse.\n\nThe ~150 buses or so in storage pale in comparison to the billions of dollars spent on MRT lines that so far remain underused. The DTL costs $20 billion, the TEL $25 billion, and that's before operating subsidies paid out to keep the lines afloat. We are opening new MRT lines every year until 2032, and if they don't learn this lesson now, they may be bleeding out on the CRL; with CRL designed more for relieving the existing network than providing new access.\n\nOttawa even had to break their bus-only system, replacing it with a train. A majority of bus services were cut back to the train terminals instead of going to downtown Ottawa, and they're a much smaller city than us. Planned extensions to the Ottawa O-Train also include pushing the bus terminals further back into line extensions, to split them up and prevent them from congesting a given terminal.\n\nOpening a new rail line every year literally means we need to do something like this every year, but that is not happening. The expectation of \"build it and the car drivers will come\", which served us well during the NSEWL and perhaps NEL years, is no longer relevant - all the more so when bus companies were able to see the impact of the coming MRT then and adapt their networks accordingly.\n\nNow you wonder why transport ministers keep talking about sustainability, but so far it seems to be all talk and no action. If MOT wants to cut public transport costs, this is where it should start, by recognizing the impact of the MRT early and taking proactive steps to manage it. There's probably more than 10 years worth of adaptation to be made.","subreddit":"singapore","comments":207,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1713n5j/the_approach_to_new_mrt_openings_is_getting/","_row":"The approach to new MRT openings is getting outdated"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-20","timestamp":1697799636,"title":"Ireland is funny","text":"I keep seeing in the news how long the wait times are for a driving test , and that there will be no amnesty for L drivers. \n\nI know many people who don\u0019t have a choice but to drive\n\nThere is no public transport outside dublin.

The study found a strong positive relationship was found between employee wellbeing, return on assets, gross profit, company valuation, and stock performance. Relevant graphs: [https://imgur.com/a/k4YiCPG](https://imgur.com/a/k4YiCPG).\n\nThe study also used employee happiness data from Indeed between October 2019 and February 2020 (pre-COVID) to predict firm performance during 2020 and 2021 and found that employee happiness predicted future firm performance.\n\nThe study analysed the impact of employee wellbeing on firm performance for 5 industries:\n\n* services\n* finance, insurance, and real estate\n* wholesale and trade\n* transportation and public utilties\n* manufacturing\n\nAgriculture, mining, and construction were not analysed due to an insufficient sample size. Employee wellbeing had a positive effect for the services, finance, insurance, real estate, and manufacturing industries, with the largest positive effect occurring for the services industry. For wholesale, trade, transportation, and public utilties, the effects were mostly insignificant. Though, due to the smaller sample size when broken down by industry, the study mentioned that the industry-specific results were less precise than the other results and should be treated as an exploratory initial analysis.\n\nThe study also found that the top 50 and top 100 highest wellbeing companies outperformed the S&amp;P500, Nasdaq 100, and Dow Jones over January 2021 to March 2023, which was the period analysed. The total return of the top 50 was higher than the top 100. The outcomes were the same when they analysed the stock performance of the top 100 companies for stressfree, satisfication, happinness, and purpose individually.\n\nBased on literature, the study discussed 6 potential reasons for these results: productivity, relationships, creativity, health, recruitment, and retention. The discussion is long, so see the study for the full discussion and supporting evidence. For a very brief summary:\n\n* Employee wellbeing was linked to employee performance. Employees with higher wellbeing worked faster, more efficiently, and more effectively.\n* Happier employees developed more supportive relationships with colleagues and supervisors, demonstrated higher capacities for cooperation and collaboration, had more satisfied and loyal customer, and were better negotiators.\n* A wide body of research demonstrated the importance of wellbeing in promoting creativity, generally defined as the production of novel and useful ideas. Happier people had greater mental flexibility and broader awareness, thereby enabling them to make sparse connections and generate original ideas.\n* There was a very strong relationship between wellbeing and health. Poor physical and mental health was linked to reduced work performance primarily due to higher rates of absenteeism and presenteeism. Employees with low job satisfaction have been found to be more likely to leave work early, arrive at work late, and miss days of work entirely.\n* Jobseekers valued employee wellbeing and avoided firms with poor wellbeing, which impacted the ability of firms to attract talent. A study examined the effects of randomly exposing job seekers to information about company happiness levels on Indeed. The experiment involved more than 23 million job seekers in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, and found that job seekers responded behaviorally to this information, by redirecting their applications away from low happiness companies to happier ones. Much of this effect was driven by job seekers \u001cscreening out\u001d low happiness firms from their job search. In follow-up analyses, the study found that by improving their score, companies could attract more applications from people viewing the company on the platform.\n* There was a negative relationship between employee wellbeing and turnover. High employee wellbeing predicted lower rates of turnover. Turnover was costly for firms. Estimates of organizational costs associated with turnover from the United States Department of Labor ranged from one half to five times of the workers\u0019 original annual salary. Some of these costs were due to lost productivity, rehiring, retraining, and loss of skill and knowledge \\[1\\]. The annual turnover/separation rates in 2021 and 2022 were 47% \\[2\\]\\[3\\]. In 2019, Gallup estimated US businesses were losing $1 trillion annually due to voluntary turnover \\[4\\].\n\nThe study cited multiple studies for each point, but they only scratched the surface. There was a very large amount of literature on employee wellbeing which basically all supported the relationship between employee wellbeing, productivity, mental health, physical health, turnover, workplace injury, business costs, and etc.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

It wasn't a sustainable way to live, so I knew something had to change.\r  \n\r  \n**The Habit-Forming Game**\r  \n\r  \nAfter reading \"**The Slight Edge**,\" I got sold on the idea of incremental progress. Forget about those magical \"quantum leaps\" that solve everything overnight. If you're waiting for motivation to get you started, don't. It's fickle. Motivation is good if it's there but it shouldn't be the foundation of the habits you create because motivation isn't always there, and when it's gone you also lose the habits that you build on top of it. \r  \n\r  \nBuild habits based on willpower. The key distinction isn't telling yourself, *\"I'm going to exercise for 30 minutes every day because I want to be healthy*,\" but rather saying, \"*I'm going to discipline myself to work out every day, because I will have enough willpower to always do that*\u001d\r  \n\r  \nEven if it's just doing one pushup a day, make your goal so achievable that you can't fail, and you'll see progress. \r  \n\r  \nSome might argue that \"simply doing just one push-up won't make a difference.\" I concur, but the reality is that you'll likely go beyond that. Once you've mustered the willpower to get down into a push-up stance and complete one, you'll often find yourself thinking, \"I can do another, and then another.\"  More often than not, you'll exceed your initial target, which not only boosts your confidence but also instills a sense of accomplishment. \r  \n\r  \nThere are also apps that can help you build habits like **Fabulous** or **Wave Coaching** and great YouTubers like **Ali Abdaal** and **Justin Sung**.\r  \n\r  \n**Reading is Fundamental**\r  \n\r  \nI got myself an e-reader, it's a game-changer. Non-fiction books can teach you a lot, and reading gives you that chance to learn directly from smart folks. Whether you're into psychology like me or something else, there's a book for that. Plus, e-readers are mad convenient. Public transport, in bed, wherever\u0014you've got a library at your fingertips.\r  \n\r  \nBooks that have had a profound impact on my life: **Mini habits, Meet Your Happy Chemicals,The Willpower Instinct, Cupid's Poisoned Arrow, Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience and Awareness Through Movement.**\r  \n\r  \n**Dopamine**\r  \n\r  \nI was naturally interested in how our brains affect self-improvement. Most folks think dopamine is the \"pleasure chemical,\" but it's really about \"wanting\" or motivation. \r  \n\r  \nSustained exposure to elevated dopamine levels leads to a reduction in dopamine receptors. Fewer receptors result in diminished motivation, poor concentration, and decreased mental acuity. Given the plethora of activities and substances around us that spike dopamine to unnatural levels, it's crucial to be mindful of our consumption patterns. Companies exploit this all the time to keep you hooked on their products.\r  \n\r  \nLimit daily activities that flood your system with dopamine but don't enrich your life in any meaningful way. By doing so, you'll restore a natural balance of dopamine receptors, making it easier to focus on tasks like reading or learning to play an instrument.\r  \n\r  \n**Discovering Flow**\r  \n\r  \nThe concept of flow is life-changing. When you're in a flow state, you're completely absorbed in what you're doing. \"**Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience**\" really drove home the importance of having challenges that match our skills. It also helped me differentiate between \"pleasure\" and \"enjoyment.\" Pleasure's easy but superficial. Enjoyment, on the other hand, helps you grow. Now, I aim to fill my day with activities like reading and making music that can become flow experience.\r  \n\r  \n**Bullet Journaling**\r  \n\r  \nEach day, I jot down my goals and how I'm feeling. But the magic happens when I list all the positive and negative activities I've done. Color-coding them helps me see at a glance how my day went, where I excelled, and where I slipped up. I use the Dayone app but there are tons of journaling apps that are free. \r  \n\r  \nSo, if you're stuck in a rut, know that change is possible. And it doesn't have to be overwhelming. Small steps, done consistently, can take you far.

It wasn\u0019t a place I\u0019d get to frequent often, but I still have clear and fond memories of stopping by the place after a school field trip.\r  \n\r  \nFor whatever reason, the thing I remember most vividly is their lime sherbet. A vibrant neon green scoop sat nestled upon a classic and unassuming waffle cone. The tart flavor of the sherbet somehow perfectly matched its bold coloration, sending a shockwave through my tastebuds.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, it\u0019s not the sherbet itself that forms the basis of my piece today but it\u0019s throne. For that classic and unassuming waffle cone is surprisingly the center of much contention. This is because Doumar\u0019s founder Abe Doumar claimed to have created the first waffle cone way back at the St. Louis World\u0019s Fair of 1904.\r  \n\r  \nIn fact, this claim is doubled down upon with a sign that hangs in the little drive-in, stating, \u001cThis is the world\u0019s first cone machine still in use today, it was used in 1905 at Coney Island N.Y. by Abe Doumar, inventor of the ice cream cone &amp; this machine.\u001d\r  \n\r  \nIt\u0019s a cool piece of hometown trivia and a source of local pride to have such a neat historical tidbit in one\u0019s backyard, and for many years, I never questioned it. That is, until the summer of 2016, when, during a tour of Budweiser in St. Louis, the tour guide related a fun fact that caught me a bit off-guard.\r  \n\r  \nPointing to an ornate chandelier adorned with carefully crafted hop ornamentation, she mentioned that the antique dated back to the 1904 St. Louis World\u0019s Fair, an event associated with a wide variety of technological and scientific developments, among them the invention of the ice cream cone, which would go on to become Missouri\u0019s official state dessert as a result all the way in 2008.\r  \n\r  \nLocal pride swelled within me, and I felt determined to go home and research the invention of the ice cream cone, hoping to defend the name of Abe Doumar. What I found was one of the most complex stories surrounding one of the simplest little inventions.\r  \n\r  \nSo strap in, and get ready to journey down the rabbit hole with me into the mysterious origins of the ice cream cone, and more specifically the waffle cone. This journey will take us back into ancient history, then into the present, where we\u0019ll discuss what in the world a World\u0019s Fair is, before investigating several claims regarding the origins of the waffle cone.\r  \n\r  \n**The History of the Ice Cream Cone**\r  \nThe tour guide that day was, unfortunately, wrong. Or rather, she was over-simplifying. I can\u0019t be too hard on her for it. After all, most people don\u0019t want an over-long lecture on the nuances involved in the invention of the ice cream cone (well, except for the lovely folks reading this of course). And it feels much more significant to say that one created the ice cream cone rather than saying that one created a sub-genre of ice cream cone that they may or may not have even created in the first place.\r  \n\r  \nIt would have been far more accurate to say that the waffle cone was created at the 1904 St. Louis World\u0019s Fair, as this is what we seemingly have evidence of. Conversely, we have evidence of \u001cice cream cones,\u001d albeit in many diverse forms, dating back thousands of years.\r  \n\r  \nFood journalist Laura B. Weiss suggests that ancient Greeks and Romans rolled and baked wafers that may have acted as a precursor to the modern ice cream cone. However, these wafers likely were not used for dessert purposes.\r  \n\r  \nIn 1807, French painter and engraver Philibert-Louis Debucourt created an etching known as The Interior of the Café Frascati, a piece that shows great talent but that, like most of his other works, was primarily focused on the cavorting upper-classes. However, what makes this work of art particularly interesting is a woman in the right-bottom corner who appears to be holding a conic dessert of some sort.\r  \n\r  \nSome scholars have suggested that this is the first pictorial representation of an ice cream cone, thereby suggesting that the treat dates back to the early 19th century. While I believe that the woman certainly seems to be holding a sort of dessert cone, I\u0019m not sure I feel comfortable saying whether it\u0019s an ice cream cone or not. I think it\u0019s just as likely to be a similar conic dessert, like one of the ones that we\u0019ll cover next. I think that we\u0019re more likely to see an ice cream cone because we\u0019re so familiar with them, but I\u0019m concerned by the lack of any corroborating evidence in this era.\r  \n\r  \nThat being said, only 18 years later in 1825, a recipe explaining how to roll \u001clittle waffles\u001d into cones appeared in the cookbook of French chef Julien Archambault. I actually tracked down an original copy of the cookbook and found the page cited (p. 346) but my French knowledge has always been& let\u0019s just say better than that of the general American public but not by much& at all&\r  \n\r  \nI perused his section on dessert pastries, but it is a \u001ctext-heavy\u001d rather than \u001clist-based\u001d cookbook, so I wasn\u0019t able to intuit much. The only dessert pastry directly on p. 346 suggests serving with cheese, and some of the later pastries seem to suggest serving with fruit or other cheeses, though nothing really close to ice cream as far as I can tell. Feel free to correct me in the comments, actual French speakers.\r  \n\r  \nThen, in 1846, Italian British chef Charles Elme Francatelli referenced using cones as an accoutrement to larger deserts in his cookbook The Modern Chef. Again, I was able to track down the original cookbook, this time with much more success, and not just because it was printed in English. Francatelli, as early as p. 428, references the use of \u001ccornets of cornucopiae filled with a little of the vanilla ice cream\u001d as part of a larger recipe for an Iced Pudding a la Cerito.\r  \n\r  \nStill, these cornets of cornucopiae had not caught on as the hip way to serve ice cream to the masses, at least not yet. Nonetheless, 19th century ice cream vendors needed something to give their customers their ice cream in, as the sweet treat had only become more popular over the course of the century.\r  \n\r  \nSadly, germ theory did not catch on with quite the same fanfare as ice cream did, and most vendors chose to dole out ice cream in \u001cpenny licks,\u001d little glass bowls, purposefully designed to make it look like one was getting more ice cream than one actually was, and that, worst of all, were meant to be reused, typically without washing.\r  \n\r  \nIn 1879, a scientific study blamed \u001cpenny licks\u001d for a recent (and deadly) outbreak of cholera in the city of London. Given just how prevalent cholera was in this era in urban England, it\u0019s hard to tell whether it was actually the fault of the \u001cpenny licks,\u001d but they almost certainly couldn\u0019t have helped. They were soon banned in the city.\r  \n\r  \nIn the 1870s, an alternative to ice cream arrived in the form of the \u001chokey-pokey,\u001d the creation of Italian immigrants in London. The \u001chokey-pokey\u001d was a mixture of coarse ice, milk, water, sugar, and cornstarch, frozen, then wrapped in paper and sold to the customer. When its inventors brought it to the United States within a few years, local newspaper lauded it for its portability, cleanliness, and convenience.\r  \n\r  \nClearly, people wanted something that could hold their sweet treats and be easily disposed of afterwards, with little to no mess or inconvenience. Ice cream vendors certainly experimented with other methods, such as wafer \u001cice cream sandwiches\u001d and molds that shaped wafers into edible bowls.\r  \n\r  \nIn 1888, English cook Agnes B. Marshall published a recipe for Cornets with Cream in her cookbook Mrs. A. B. Marshall\u0019s Book of Cookery that called for making the cornets out of almonds and baking them in the oven rather than pressing them. Many sources refer to Marshall as the inventor of the modern ice cream cone, but I\u0019m at a bit of a loss as to why, considering her recipe seems no closer to the modern ice cream cone than her predecessors.\r  \n\r  \nPersonally, I\u0019m of the mind that we either need to go further back than this to declare an inventor of the original ice cream cone or go further ahead to where the ice cream cone actually begins to look like a modern ice cream cone, which is just a few years later at the 1904 St. Louis World\u0019s Fair.\r  \n\r  \n**The 1904 St. Louis World\u0019s Fair**\r  \nMany of us who run in true crime circles are most familiar with the idea of the world\u0019s fair are most familiar with the 1893 Chicago World\u0019s Fair (also known as the World\u0019s Columbian Exposition). Because of the magnificent architecture, numerous innovations, and the proximity of early American serial killer H.H. Holmes, the Exposition has rightly warranted much consideration, perhaps most famously in Erik Larson\u0019s fascinating and fantastic book The Devil in the White City.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, the 1904 St. Louis World\u0019s Fair (also known as the Louisiana Purchase Exposition) similarly helped transform America\u0019s identity as it headed from a 19th century that had been generally isolationist into a 20th century where it would become a global superpower with its own unique form of empire.\r  \n\r  \nThis new American imperialism was showcased in the Exposition\u0019s most controversial and uncomfortable inclusion: human beings on display. The United States had begun non-contiguous expansion in the wake of the Spanish-American War of 1898, through which the United States acquired the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines.\r  \n\r  \nThe Philippines, in particular, had fought back against American annexation. The Philippine Revolution had actually begun not against American rule but against Spanish rule, in 1896. After the Spanish-American War ended with Spain ceding the Philippines, the American government refused to acknowledge the Filipino declaration of independence, leading to the Philippine American War from 1899-1902.\r  \n\r  \nThe war was bloody and gruesome, killing several thousand American soldiers, over ten thousand Filipino revolutionaries, and resulting in the death of over 200,000 Filipino civilians, mostly as a result of conditions created by the war, notably starvation and disease. And yet, just two short years later, here were Filipinos on display as an exhibit at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.\r  \n\r  \nSome of the 1,102 Filipinos brought in for the Exposition died to the absurdly harsh conditions they were put through. Traditional burial practices were denied.\r  \n\r  \nAcross the fair, attendees marveled at the seeming magic of wireless telephones and a new medical scanning technology called an x-ray. Within the Palace of Transportation, they were wowed by personal gas-powered automobiles; they would be able to own their own sooner than they likely realized.\r  \n\r  \nPeople could get around on an electric streetcar, which was still relatively new, and came to the fair to see the benefits of a more electric future. They could observe premature infants in infant incubators, which weren\u0019t necessarily new but weren\u0019t widely accepted. By bringing these incubators to several World\u0019s Fairs, their creators helped people see the vital nature of these devices, which likely led to many young lives being saved in the years to come.\r  \n\r  \nMy point in highlighting this is to give you a sense of the reality and the duality of these World\u0019s Fairs. I feel like it\u0019s something we can\u0019t properly conceive of because they eventually faded away, no longer a huge draw for American and international audiences. Additionally, such World\u0019s Fairs would have become increasingly awkward following the atrocities that marked the early 20th century.\r  \n\r  \nBut my point is that these World\u0019s Fairs were a theatre in which to showcase the wonderful and the terrible. Larson makes similar points in The Devil in the White City, but I think it\u0019s even more pronounced at the 1904 St. Louis World\u0019s Fair because the wonderful and the terrible co-existed within the official confines of the fair itself.\r  \n\r  \nOne could see the wonders of modern medicine and technology, then turn a corner and see a human zoo, a zoo that was far more concerned with entertainment than with cultural accuracy and that completely objectified its inhabitants, one of which, a Congolese Pygmy, was later featured in an exhibit on evolution alongside an orangutan, a crass display that was thankfully shut down due to protest.\r  \n\r  \nI\u0019m sure that plenty won\u0019t care for this aside, given its seeming lack of relevance to the original topic, but I think it\u0019s worth stopping for a minute to examine what a World\u0019s Fair is, warts and all, before simply singing the praises of an invention that sprung from it. It\u0019s important, at least to me, to contextualize the environments in which these events take place.\r  \n\r  \n**The Invention of the Waffle Cone**\r  \nThe story behind the waffle cone\u0019s creation is actually rather simple and (perhaps a tad bit too) convenient. At the 1904 St. Louis World\u0019s Fair, an ice cream vendor runs out of paper cups in which to sell his ice cream. Nearby, another vendor, usually a Syrian immigrant, sees a business opportunity.\r  \n\r  \nRolling a thin waffle cookie (I\u0019ve seen some sources say zalabia, which doesn\u0019t feel right based on the images of zalabia I\u0019ve seen) into a conic shape, the vendor plopped a scoop of ice cream on top, and the waffle cone was born!\r  \n\r  \nWe, in fact, have proof that the waffle cone was, indeed, at the 1904 St. Louis World\u0019s Fair. Several photographs of different families eating ice cream out of waffle cones exist around the internet and within the Missouri State Archives.\r  \n\r  \nAdditionally, the St. Louis Daily Globe-Democrat ran an article praising the cones (linked below). While they call the cone an \u001cice cream sandwich,\u001d their description along with an illustration of the \u001csandwich\u001d make it clear that they\u0019re referring to the waffle cone. The problem is that we don\u0019t know what vendor anybody got their waffle cones from, and that\u0019s where things start to get real messy.\r  \n\r  \nYou see, it\u0019s not even clear whether the famous story is even true. Was the waffle cone truly born from a moment of desperation? If so, the two vendors must have mastered the art of the waffle cone rather quickly, as those in surviving photos from the fair look pristine. Alternatively, others have proposed that the waffle cone was a vendor\u0019s way of getting a leg-up in a highly competitive battle for concessionaire spots at the fair.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, if the classic story proves to be true, there are multiple claimants to actually inventing the waffle cone. Perhaps the best known is Ernest Hamwi, who claims that he was the Syrian immigrant running the waffle cookie stand that originally rolled the first waffle cone.\r  \n\r  \nAlbert and Nick Kabbaz, also Syrian immigrants, would later claim that they were working for Hamwi that day and originally had the idea to roll up a waffle into a cone, which Hamwi then stole from them. \r  \n\r  \nArnold Fornachou and David Avayou have both also made dubious claims to being the Syrian immigrant vendor themselves.\r  \n\r  \nAbe Doumar, progenitor of the Norfolk-based drive-in mentioned in my introduction, has a slightly different claim. According to the Doumar\u0019s website, Abe, who is also a Syrian immigrant, claims to have simply been in the right place at the right time. He says he was there when the ice cream vendor ran out of cups, bought a waffle, rolled it himself, then asked for a scoop of ice cream plopped on top of it.\r  \n\r  \nThough there is evidence that Doumar was running a four-iron cone press just a year later in Coney Island and even though he and his legacy have established a local favorite based around this origin story, I have to admit that Doumar\u0019s claims are specious at best. If you go to the Doumar\u0019s website, you\u0019ll see that Doumar claims to have spent the rest of that summer selling ice cream in waffle cones.\r  \n\r  \nHow did Doumar go from patron (or vendor of unspecified wares) to ice cream and cone proprietor in no time at all. Given how fiercely others had to fight to get a concessions slot at the 1904 St. Louis World\u0019s Fair, I question whether this would have even been possible. At the end of the day, as much as I hate to say it, the evidence points to the Doumar\u0019s story being fabricated.\r  \n\r  \nMy personal guess is that Abe Doumar was indeed there that summer. He saw a stand selling the waffle cones, and being a bright young entrepreneur, brainstormed the idea for a four-iron cone maker that would allow him to roll one cone while three more cooked, then brought that idea to various tourist destinations across the east coast before settling in Norfolk. Or the stand at the World\u0019s Fair already had four irons, and he just stole that too. I\u0019m not really sure to be completely honest.\r  \n\r  \nQuite interestingly, the Library of Congress identifies someone else entirely as the progenitor of the waffle cone. Perhaps the only claimant who wasn\u0019t a Syrian immigrant, Charles E. Menches claimed to be the waffle cookie vendor on that fateful day at the 1904 St. Louis World\u0019s Fair and asserted that it was he and his brother Frank\u0019s idea to place his ice cream into the rolled waffle cookies.\r  \n\r  \nSo how do we make sense of these various claims, almost all of them bullishly asserting their claim without evidence to support it?\r  \n\r  \n**Chasing the Ameri-Cone Dream**\r  \nLet\u0019s revisit the idea of the human zoo. As discussed above, these human zoos were not particularly interested in providing a factual representation of the peoples they put on display. Rather they engaged in a form of myth-making that relied heavily on stereotype, providing a narrative that was meant to draw people in and amaze them rather than educate them.\r  \n\r  \nThe benefactors of these zoos knew that they were highly unlikely to attract customers with the truth, so they spun a fiction that would be far more attractive and fascinating to their clientele. And it worked; the human zoos were highly popular.\r  \n\r  \nI think we see an interesting parallel here with our plethora of alleged waffle cone inventors. Because without their various stories of inventing the waffle cone at the 1904 St. Louis World\u0019s Fair, what did they have? Immigrant-owned businesses fighting an uphill battle to make it, to achieve their own version of the American Dream&\r  \n\r  \nWas it dishonest? Certainly. But in a nation that was more than happy to spin all sorts of false narratives about them, why not turn it around and create a false narrative around oneself?\r  \n\r  \nWas it effective? I don\u0019t think there\u0019s any doubting that it was. With a narrative that put their businesses at the center of history, these immigrants had a powerful draw. Perhaps more indicative of this than anything is that some of these businesses have survived to the modern day where countless similar businesses have failed.\r  \n\r  \nBut it\u0019s evident too in just how heavily these businesses market their claim to fame. Doumar\u0019s claims \u001cA History as Rich as Our Custom Made Ice Cream\u001d on their website; clicking on it takes you to Abe Doumar\u0019s epic story of inventing the waffle cone. Menches Brothers claims, \u001cThis is a taste of history.\u001d It\u0019s more difficult to find their claim to inventing the waffle cone on their website, as they tend to prioritize their supposed invention of the hamburger instead.\r  \n\r  \nPerhaps most damning to all these claims is that most of them didn\u0019t become public until almost a decade after the 1904 St. Louis World\u0019s Fair. While it\u0019s clear from photographs that waffle cones were at the World\u0019s Fair, no one seems to have made an immediate claim to inventing the cone afterwards, which one would expect if it truly came about in the ingenious manner that is so often recounted.\r  \n\r  \nIs it possible that one of these men truly did invent the waffle cone at the World\u0019s Fair and simply didn\u0019t go public with their claims for nearly a full decade? Sure, but I don\u0019t think it\u0019s particularly likely.\r  \n\r  \nWhat I find far more likely is the possibility that the lack of a claimant created a mysterious void that was perfect for clever entrepreneurs to spin to their own benefit. Frankly, I think that what most likely happened is that none of these men invented the waffle cone. I think it was likely a brilliant way to get around the need for cups and thus additional waste or the spreading of germs that simply wasn't immediately claimed or patented.\r  \n\r  \nThe invention of the waffle cone is likely far more mundane than we\u0019ve been led to believe after over a century of fantastical stories of human ingenuity, but the truth is, none of these stories add up. None of them add up, at least, until we begin to consider what these entrepreneurs gained. They had a product to sell, and the story of the waffle cone made that product so much more marketable and a far bigger draw, even if, admittedly, the lime sherbet is pretty darn good.\r  \n\r  \n**Sources**\r  \n[https://doumars.com/norfolk-ghent-doumar-s-cones-and-barbeque-history](https://doumars.com/norfolk-ghent-doumar-s-cones-and-barbeque-history)\r  \n[https://www.seriouseats.com/ice-cream-cone-history](https://www.seriouseats.com/ice-cream-cone-history)\r  \n[https://www.thedailymeal.com/1276928/complete-history-ice-cream-cone/](https://www.thedailymeal.com/1276928/complete-history-ice-cream-cone/)\r  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice\\_cream\\_cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream_cone)\r  \n[https://www.loc.gov/item/today-in-history/july-23](https://www.loc.gov/item/today-in-history/july-23)\r  \n[https://www.sos.mo.gov/CMSImages/Publications/symbols/icecreamarticle.pdf](https://www.sos.mo.gov/CMSImages/Publications/symbols/icecreamarticle.pdf)\r  \n[https://www.menchesbros.com/story/](https://www.menchesbros.com/story/)\r  \n[https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/RP-P-2009-291](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/RP-P-2009-291)\r  \n[https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6276567c.texteImage](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6276567c.texteImage)\r  \n[https://archive.org/details/b21530154/page/428/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/b21530154/page/428/mode/2up)\r\r  \n","subreddit":"UnresolvedMysteries","comments":16,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/17cd0kw/chasing_the_americone_dream_the_mysterious_origin/","_row":"Chasing the Ameri-Cone Dream: The Mysterious Origin of Waffle Cones at the 1904 St. Louis World\u0019s Fair"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-18","timestamp":1697636909,"title":"All of the things I hated about Pittsburgh","text":"I lived in Pittsburgh from 2011 to 2014. The first year was outside of the city. For the sake of this post, I'll ignore that year since the outskirts of every American city is a dismal hellscape. Also, I only rent. \n\n1. **Weather**: Pittsburgh was the first place where I noticed the sky. In NYC one only really thinks about the weather when it is extreme. Other than that there are too many interesting things going on in the city to pay attention to that. From October to April the sun disappears. Turns out this is awful for someone with depression. If you want grey weather, but cooler, the PNW is the place to go.\n2. **Culture**: Pittsburgh is a city of sports and bars. By sports, I mean that people watch sports. I was shocked by the amount of smoking, alcohol consumption, and overeating. Pretty much everything in the city revolves around that. There are small subcultures of rock climbers, dancers, cyclists, etc - but the respective communities are tiny and overlapping. (**NOTE**: if you are a climber or slackliner with an interest in proximity to West Virginia, this is the place for you). Any other athletic community outside of that is incredibly small.\n3. **Culture, pt2**: The divide between white and black people in Pittsburgh is NUTS. It felt like these respective groups existed in different worlds. There were also no immigrants at all. It felt like stories of what the US in the 70s was like. Many black people there were standoffish about non-American black people claiming anything that isn't black American culture. If you know, you know. In DC or NYC there were Haitians, Dominicans, Nigerians, Ethiopians, Jamaicans, Trinidadians, etc. Lots of people in the big East Coast cities are also mixed, but you never really had to explain yourself to people. \n4. **Public Transportation**: I can't fault Pittsburgh too much, as most American cities are bad at this. Outside of Highland Park, Squirrel Hill, Downtown, Oakland, and the like - public transportation is awful. \n5. **Food**: No Beef Patties and Coco bread = instant C- on food\n6. **Police**: Don't get me wrong - the NYPD are terrifying, but I never learned true fear of cops until I moved to Pittsburgh. I was always on foot, so in the event I did get stopped I was always in some gods-forsaken underpopulated part of the city. If anything happened to me there would be no one to film the situation and no one to advocate for me. Sprinkle in the racialized politics of the city and the stage is set for some f\\*ckery. \n7. **Racism, Level 1**: I regret not keeping an active record of all of the wild racist shit people said to me. I remember a conversation at one place where I worked. If I recall correctly it was my first week and I was being trained. She said some quote from some old show, I can't remember which one, but it was met by a blank and confused look on my part. \"Oh, you don't know that? What did you grow up with? Driveby shootings?\".  This person did not know me or my story (yes, I did grow up in really bad neighborhoods, but I easily could have been a middle-class kid). \n8. **Racism, Level 50+**: Turns out there are lots of racist conventions in central and western PA. I had a run-in with a handful of these f\\*cks while walking alongside an exurban road.  Luckily they did not get out of their van. I was alone, a half mile from any kind of help, and had they decided to do more than honking and heckling, this would be a very different story. \n9. **Nature**: there are ticks everywhere. This is an issue all over the East Coast outside of Maine and Vermont (I think), so I can't uniquely blame PA here. \n10. **Cost of living**: If you make minimum wage or near minimum wage, life will still be hard. At least when you are cash-strapped in NYC you can find ways to live life. Not being able to afford a car means you are locked out of everything outside of a handful of neighborhoods, and even then it is incredibly annoying to get around.\n11. **Accent**: The Pittsburgh accent is like the Baltimore accent. It was the first time when I realized that even AAVE has enough variation that mutual intelligibility can become difficult. \n\nThings I liked\n\n1. **Geography**: the hills ringing the center of the city are impressive. There are dozens of spots where you can find breathtaking views\n2. **Autumn**: this one speaks for itself. PA is a stunning place in the autumn.\n3. **The City**: the city was built for nearly 700K people, and currently has a population of 300K. It made the city feel like Fallout, Stalker, Yharnam (without the charm of Edinburgh) - take your pick.\n4. **Memories**: I fell in love for the first time in Pittsburgh. Started my first steps to dealing my depression there as well.\n5. **Parkour spots**: The architecture of the city, high levels of abandonment, and the density of universities in Oakland made for some of the best Parkour spots I've seen in the country. It is a shame there weren't more people here to take advantage of it.\n6. **Village feel near the city center**: I don't remember if it was Lawrenceville, but there was a cute outdoor market on the weekends. There were also cute eateries that didn't cost an arm and a leg for good quality espresso and yummy pastries.\n7. **Proximity to NYC and DC**\n8. **Megabus**: Not sure what the prices are now, but megabus prices from Pittsburgh were dirt cheap. If I needed to get out of town for a while I could.","subreddit":"SameGrassButGreener","comments":587,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/17ar8yk/all_of_the_things_i_hated_about_pittsburgh/","_row":"All of the things I hated about Pittsburgh"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-28","timestamp":1695872110,"title":"6:53 EEST; The Sun is Rising Over Kyiv on the 582nd Day of the Full-Scale Invasion.

This is how the world saw Izium.**\n\n**But over the past 80 years, the city has twice become a battlefield, and some of its residents were under occupation twice in their lifetimes, consequently waiting for liberation twice. There still remain remnants of the bridge built by the Nazis, buildings that have already survived one war and witnessed the current one, and, most importantly, there are still people who remember it.**\n\n**Mariia Kapanina**, who used to work as a teacher and librarian in schools #4 and #6, vividly remembers what Izium and its outskirts were like before and during WWII. The woman was born and raised on a farmstead near Izium that has since been abandoned, much like most such settlements. 90 years ago, there were up to 30 houses; now, there are about 30 people. On February 23, 2022, Mariia celebrated her 92nd birthday with her family.\n\nThe author of this story was also born and raised in Izium. It was his first trip home after the city\u0019s liberation in September 2022. He met Mariia accidentally when his friend asked him to bring her mother and grandmother a heater in Izium. Mariia was very grateful for his help and was very friendly. So they agreed to talk.\n\nIt fell to a 92-year-old woman both to survive WWII and the full-scale Russian-Ukrainian war. Having an exceptional memory, Mariia explains what is common and different between these murderous events.\n\n# Life between WWII and the Russian invasion\n\n[Mariia says that Taras Shevchenko's poems resemble the present day very closely](https://preview.redd.it/jinwnlpzqvqb1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41ea3cd3969fcd6a28a92a0212d4494456b2b5d4)\n\n&gt;\u0014 I saw them a few times. I was standing on the balcony, and they (Russian occupiers \u0014 ed.) were distributing food downstairs. One of them came under the balcony and said to me, \u001cWe\u0019ve brought soup, help yourself.\u001d I didn\u0019t go. I said, \u001cThank you very much, but I\u0019ve cooked some soup myself.\u001d\n\nMariia\u0019s first contact with Russians was when they occupied Izium in the spring of 2022. These invaders were not the first ones in her life.\n\nMariia has two daughters. One left the city during the occupation, and the other still lives with her. Their apartment is calm and quiet, with only the wall clock ticking rhythmically. There are selected works by the legendary Ukrainian authors Ostap Vyshnia and Taras Shevchenko on the shelf next to Mariia\u0019s armchair. \u001cIt\u0019s a great pity for Ukraine,\u001d the woman sighs and points out that Kobzar\u0019s \\[Shevchenko -Ed.\\] poems closely resemble the present.\n\nDuring our two-hour conversation, it becomes clear that Mariia is blessed with almost phenomenal memory. She vividly remembers even the weather at the beginning of the Nazi occupation in 1942 and when the shooting stopped on May 9th, 1945.\n\n&gt;\u0014 I remember Kharkiv after the war; the ruins were still everywhere. In 1949, we went to clear the debris on clean-up days, right where the \u001cUkraine\u001d cinema is located in Shevchenko Park now \u0014 Mariia recollects the post-war city.\n\nIn her story, the words \u001cI remember\u001d sound frequently. There is an age gap of about 70 years between us. Mariia\u0019s story about the two wars is elaborated with the diary of the Russian-Ukrainian war kept by her daughters Natalia and Olena during the temporary occupation.\n\n# How the wars in Izium started\n\nIn 1941, Mariia finished the 4th grade. She lived in the village of Holubivka (now almost extinct) next to Izium with her grandparents. She heard about the beginning of the war from her grandpa:\n\n&gt;\u0014 I remember the first days of the war very well. Grandfather delivered the mail to the villages and brought the news: the war broke out. There still was no radio back then, nothing. And he brought the first call-up papers. I also remember the first reports about the fatalities in the village.\n\nBefore the German occupation of the village, there were explosions in the area that destroyed the houses, while the farmstead itself was left without authorities. Soon, the occupiers arrived.\n\n&gt;\u0014 In 1942, I remember how the Germans came. It was summer, it was so hot, and the sun was blazing& There was only one street in the village. So they came in threes on motorcycles with sidecars, in threes with accordions. They seemed exhilarated as they passed by. But after some time, on the same day, the cars came. They shouted: \u001cEggs, chickens!\u001d and took everything from the houses&\n\nWhile narrating this incident, Mariia closes her eyes and sighs heavily. She interrupts the story almost immediately as if she is afraid that she won\u0019t have enough time to tell everything \u0014 there are so many things kept in her memory, so many painful, dreadful memories. Looting began with the occupation: the German occupiers took a boar away from Mariia\u0019s family.\n\n&gt;\u0014 And then they went into my aunt\u0019s yard next door to catch chickens. A dog was running on a chain so they couldn\u0019t get to the henhouse. They fired a shot at the dog. It is in agony, blood clotting, it ran to the barn into the pigsty (a place where pigs are kept. \u0014 ed.). I\u0019ll never forget that.\n\nThe occupation of Izium began alike 80 years later. The Russian military fired artillery shells onto the city on the night of February 26-27, 2022. It\u0019s absurd, but the Russians have started \u001cdenazifying\u001d the city centre\u0019s first streets, like the one named after the hero of the USSR, pilot Captain Orlov, who fought over Izium. In a couple of days, Russian airstrikes began, which demolished the city\u0019s residential quarters.\n\n\u001cThey\u0019ve been bombing the city. They blew up the police office. The medical school was on fire. At night, they shelled the centre, the building of the \u001cPoliushko\u001d store was on fire. The explosion was horrifying. We spent the rest of the night in the built-in closet in the hallway,\u001d reads the first entry in the diary, dated March 2nd, 2022.\n\nDuring WWII, Mariia lived in a small house with her grandmother, grandfather, uncles, aunts and their children, seven people altogether. Shelling occurred all around, but the village itself remained intact. The family woke up at sunrise (they had no clock), grandmother baked bread in the oven, and grandfather went to the windmill to grind flour.\n\nEighty years later, in 2022, Mariia faced the war again, this time also with her nearest and dearest daughters, who comforted and cared for her.\n\nBoth during the German and the current Russian occupation, Mariia was concerned with the lives of her relatives and animals. For instance, the woman says a grey cat came to her house last summer and settled there. Shortly after, the cat gave birth to kittens, and the family hid those in a hencoop next to the house. These days, there are always a bunch of multicoloured cats curling up near the porch. During the full-scale invasion, the number of abandoned animals on the streets of Izium increased. Once, I noticed a small black dog with a caramel-coloured muzzle next to a bakery, circling, scared to approach people, and even shuddering at the sound of a crunching waffle, which I wanted to feed it.\n\n[Photo by the author, Olexander Myasyschev.](https://preview.redd.it/6bh6zpcarvqb1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46d59d617be0023f4c3f485fcf948a38f581b814)\n\nThe light outside the window of Mariia\u0019s apartment is fading. Adults pace bit by bit every few minutes, or children run along the street. During the war, at least 13,000 of them stayed here. Sometimes, an olive green pickup truck with a white cross on the door drives by \u0014 that\u0019s Ukrainian military. Their cars make up the majority over here these days.\n\nShe continues her story, just stopping and asking occasionally: \u001cAre you interested? Haven\u0019t I tired you out?\u001d\n\nWhile discussing the modern war now, Mariia mentions WWII at once, as its wounds have not yet healed. Among other things, she talks about her father, who joined the army in July 1941. Until 1943, he fought near Moscow, and the family did not know whether he was alive. They hadn\u0019t seen each other for two years.\n\n&gt;\u0014 All of a sudden, one evening in late April 1943 right when the cherry trees started to bloom, he came. It turned out that he walked 50 kilometres from his military unit in Kupiansk to our place.\n\nMariia\u0019s father suffered four serious injuries near Izium in a few months. In a single day, his arm was wounded, an enemy fragment got him under the shoulder blade, and a bullet punched out his calf. Another shell splinter shattered the kneecap on the other leg, causing the limb to be amputated. He spent a long time in a hospital in the village of Kantemyrivka in Poltavshchyna. To visit him, Mariia\u0019s mother walked more than 200 km.\n\n# What\u0019s been happening in Izium during the occupations\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bz55ebpervqb1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2bc42434669c0f19c3802442dba37677da8e849\n\nAirstrikes and missiles have caused the most significant destruction to Izium. Apartment blocks collapsed from aircraft bombs, burying whole families underneath. In March 2022, 54 people died under the five-storey building at Pershotravneva Street alone. Debris removal began here no sooner than a few months after the tragedy.\n\nIzium and nearby settlements were destroyed by aeroplanes decades ago as well. The house where Mariia lived was next to the railway and was attacked by the Germans:\n\n&gt;\u0014 We heard lots of explosions and saw many planes. Once, my mother and sister went to the vegetable garden, and I was in the yard. Special freight trains with evacuees were going to the east. Military ones were heading to the west, carrying tanks covered with tarpaulin. One day, the planes flew over and started firing machine guns! The train stopped, and they also kept shooting from there. Standing in the yard, I could even see the pilot: red-haired, wearing glasses. Where to run? I got inside, well& I stuck my head under the floor mat where the beets were stored. Then I felt my mother dragging my legs, and we went to the cellar.\n\nThe house in Izium where Mariia lives now is already far from the railway, although it stopped almost from the beginning of the war due to the occupiers bombed it.\n\n\u001cThe house at Chervonopraporna street (west of the city \u0014 ed.) was burning all night. Every bit of it has burned down. The sight is gruesome. We are sitting and recollecting whose apartments were there. It is very terrifying when you observe how life is being destroyed. We will not live as before,\u001d reads a diary entry as of March 10, 2022.\n\nMariia shares many other vital chapters of her life between the wartime memories. Time and again, the family moved homes in the post-war years, and she mentions her first job in a library and the early years of her granddaughter\u0019s life. It\u0019s tangible how important it is for her to convey her \u001cI remember.\u001d\n\nShe recalls how she first came to work at school and, over the years, received the \u001cExcellence in Public Education\u001d award \\[An incentive award in the USSR granted to educators in 1945-1991\\]. At this point, her daughter brings us tea, and the room becomes noticeably warmer from the heating. In the winter of 2022, such a luxury as warm heating radiators was available to residents of less than half of all apartment blocks in the city. People mainly warmed themselves using small heaters.\n\nDuring the temporary occupation, Russian invaders moved into houses from which the city residents have been evacuated, and some have even been kicked out of their homes. All that remained in the surviving houses was a pile of rubbish and boxes from the Russian \u001cVoyentorg\u001d dry rations. A new wave of destruction blanketed the city when it became a \u001chuman shield\u001d for the invaders. Russian military hid their equipment near the houses of the Izium residents to evade attacks of the Ukrainian Defense Forces.\n\n\u001cAn armoured personnel carrier with soldiers stopped next to the water pump. We watched them out of the window. The soldiers started shooting, so we even scooched down in the hallway. It was the first time we\u0019ve seen them up close near the house,\u001d reads a diary entry as of March 8, 2022.\n\nThere were different occupiers in Izium, Mariia says. While particular could even give some food, others carried out raids and checked every apartment. The manhunt for pro-Ukrainian \u001cdangerous\u001d individuals throughout the city is only the tip of the iceberg of Russian war crimes. Only after the city\u0019s liberation were torture chambers and executions of civilians revealed to the world.\n\n# The current war and victory\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yz7juwllrvqb1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a4ee59e1aaa991588ede7d06beace885ddc54b4\n\nMariia talks about the full-scale war aversely, with great pain in her voice; these memories are too fresh and full of different emotions. What hurts her the most is the betrayal of the locals, who lived next door for years and happily wished the Russians success.\n\n&gt;\u0014 I am 92 years old now, and I probably haven\u0019t cried as many tears in all the years as I have since February 24th \\[2022\\]. I\u0019m scared, I can\u0019t&I realise that I\u0019m a person of an older generation, but& There were such looters here. As early as February 24th, ours were already plundering and breaking; there were no Russians in Izium back then!\n\nOf course, not everyone turned out to be traitors. Mariia\u0019s family and her neighbours swapped food, water and fire. Local rescuers brought milk and bread from nearby villages. Residents who started volunteering also have been helping: they brought food, even if they found themselves under shelling.\n\nThe need to talk about war life and share the pain is what brings together and unites the locals. Many of them are also shocked while recalling the neighbours with whom they lived side by side for years, who then collaborated with the occupiers. Already after I had a word Mariia, on the way to the Izium railway station, a local resident Valeriy tells about it:\n\n&gt;\u0014 Some put it in the sack, \u001csnatched away\u001d entire stores and even offered it to me. They said it is now possible because Russia will be here from now on. But I said that Russia would never be here.\n\nHe is about 40 years old and works as a taxi driver in an old car. In a few months after the liberation of Izium, such cars were the only means of transportation here. The first marshrutkas (local buses \u0014 ed.) launched services in the last days of 2022.\n\nPerhaps it would not have been possible to completely occupy Izium if it were not for the collaborators. On March 1, 2022, the invaders occupied half of the city, divided by the Siverskyi Donets River. The centre was on the other bank and Kremenets hill, where the Ukrainian flag was flying.\n\nOne of the traitors was a local MP from the Russian-backed OPFL party and a communist Anatoliy Fomichevskiy. He will be tried in absentia for having shown the occupiers the way to the city.\n\nHowever, many Izium residents resisted the Russians, even during the temporary occupation. Locals joined the territorial defence forces, became partisans, and supported their people as much as possible. For instance, it is known that Izium partisans conducted a raid that destroyed ten occupiers. There were also the braves who hid Ukrainian flags and even flew them boldly in the last days of the occupation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/47lbhxrvrvqb1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9198a107c945c2512bc25ac0c4985dfe2d0f77cf\n\nAt the end of WWII Mariia\u0019s family lived in the village of Buhaiivka about 40 kilometers from the centre of Izium. This is how the woman recollects the day the war ended:\n\n&gt;\u0014 I was in the sixth grade. I remember this day, May 9, 1945. There was a little rain. We woke up: there was sun and such freshness! Such warmth, as if nature was smiling. And we watched as people ran to the center of the village. We reached it, and there was a spontaneous rally. The head teacher of the school, Ivan Tymofiiovych, spoke there, he lost his leg in the war. I best remembered his speech. He said, \u001cChildren, you are joyful now, your parents and your brothers will come back soon. And some among you are standing and realising that theirs will never return.\u001d And there was an outcry, tears, and laughter at once \u0014 it was hair-raising. That\u0019s how victory came.\n\nThe atmosphere in Izium was completely different 80 years later, the day before the Russian military escaped. Mariia says that before leaving the city the occupiers announced a curfew for a week. The noise of the continuous movement of vehicles came from the main road.\n\n&gt;\u001cDisturbing. The whole day, there were bursts; apparently, another ammunition depot was hit. People can\u0019t be seen \u0014 they have hidden, and the street is empty. There is no gas.

We're trying to find ways to cut costs so we can stay afloat.\n\nDoes anyone have tips for living frugally here in the Netherlands they'd be willing to share? Some specific questions I have:\n\n* How often do you eat out or order delivery vs. cooking at home? What are some inexpensive homemade meals you'd recommend?\n* Where do you find the best grocery discounts and deals? Do you buy in bulk and if so where?\n* How do you take advantage of free activities around the country? What are some of your favorite free parks, museums, events etc?\n* Is public transportation here really cheaper than driving? Do you carpool or bike places?\n* What's your strategy for buying vs. renting things like appliances?\n* Where have you found the best secondhand clothes, furniture, etc? Do you use sites like Marktplaats and Vinted?\n* Do you repair clothes and maintain your home yourself? \n* How do you reduce energy costs?\n\nReally any tips or tricks you have for living frugally as a family here in the Netherlands would be so appreciated! My wife and I want to make changes so we can get back on track financially. Thank you for any advice you can offer!\n\n\n-----------------\n\nHere is an exhaustive summary of the tips provided in the comments so far:\n\n**Food/Groceries:**\n\n- Avoid ordering delivery. Eat home-cooked meals instead using inexpensive ingredients like beans, lentils, and seasonal veggies.\n\n- Shop at Turkish, Asian, ALDI, and LIDL for discounted meats, grains, and spices. Check supermarket apps and flyers for deals. \n\n- Use TooGoodToGo to find discounted about-to-expire foods. Check food markets for deals.\n\n- Make big batches of food and freeze portions to save time and money. Meal plan around what's on sale. \n\n- Cook seasonally. Limit meat. Look at r/EatCheapAndHealthy for ideas.\n\n**Activities:**\n\n- Take advantage of free museums/events on discount days. Get a museumkaart or zoo season pass to save on multiple visits.\n\n- Geocaching, local events, and visiting parks are low/no-cost activities. Check city event listings (e.g., uitin[cityName].nl ).\n\n**Transport:**\n\n- Bike whenever possible. Public transit is only cheaper than driving solo. Consider carpooling apps to save (e.g., BlaBlaCar).\n\n**Housing/Appliances:**\n\n- Buy and repair appliances instead of renting. Borrow from neighbors occasionally. Check Peerby to borrow.\n\n- DIY fixes and maintenance when possible. Install insulation, solar panels, and smart thermostats to save energy. \n\n- Turn off unused lights, and lower heat at night. Take shorter showers. Compare energy use to averages.\n\n**Shopping:**\n\n- Buy secondhand clothes, furniture, toys via kringloopwinkels, Marktplaats, Facebook. Check before buying new.\n\n- Buy on sale and in bulk when possible. Make shopping lists and stick to them to avoid impulse purchases.\n\n**General:**\n\n- Live frugally as a lifestyle, not just to save money. Spend on meaningful experiences over material items.\n\n- Connect with neighbors, and friends to share resources. Barter services to save money. \n\n- Research all available subsidies, benefits, and tax deductions. Every bit helps.","subreddit":"Netherlands","comments":199,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/175cdjc/tips_for_living_frugally_in_the_netherlands/","_row":"Tips for Living Frugally in the Netherlands?"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-13","timestamp":1697198227,"title":"Why is the AC in German public transportation always off?","text":"I have to sonehow understand what's the obsession for keeping it off, regardless of the temperature inside the bus/tram/train...\n\nDo Germans feel the need to be roasted? \n\nDoesn't matter if it's 30 degrees or 35, German transportation will remain a furnace. \n\nAny idea why?

Having personally heard of a few recent cases of Londoners getting bedbugs after staying in student accomodation, AirBnB's or cheap hotels like Travelodge, I thought it might be handy to do a thread on bedbug signs to look out for and how to avoid them.\n\n**Size:** Adult bedbugs are typically 5-7mm long (which is about the same size as an apple seed) but start off life only 1mm long, which is the same size as their small, white eggs.\n\n**Appearance:** Bedbugs change in both size, shape and colour not just over the course of their lives but also depending on whether they had fed recently, a while ago or a very long time ago. This image [https://www.pestworld.org/media/562756/bed-bugs-on-quarter.jpg](https://www.pestworld.org/media/562756/bed-bugs-on-quarter.jpg) shows the changes over their lives (plus fed VS unfed) and this image [https://citybugs.tamu.edu/files/2010/12/bed-bug-feeding-Whitney-Cranshawb.jpg](https://citybugs.tamu.edu/files/2010/12/bed-bug-feeding-Whitney-Cranshawb.jpg) shows how much a bedbug can change in shape and overall appearance over the course of a single feed.\n\nSigns of bedbugs:\n\n**Gaps:** Bedbugs are primarily nocturnal animals and during the day they will retreat into tiny cracks and crevices (which is where they also lay their eggs in), living in colonies, meaning that you don't typically see them scuttling around during the day. Favourite bedbug hiding spots often include seams in mattresses (classic example: [https://i.pinimg.com/originals/af/0a/46/af0a46df679d7b121ecaca7053997ff1.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/af/0a/46/af0a46df679d7b121ecaca7053997ff1.jpg) ), in-between the joins in bedframes or other furniture and inside splits or holes in wood (classic example: [https://u2y4v6x2.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Can-Bed-Bugs-Live-In-Wood-Furniture.jpg](https://u2y4v6x2.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Can-Bed-Bugs-Live-In-Wood-Furniture.jpg) ).\n\n**Patches:** Bedbugs diet of blood causes their faeces to stain soft &amp; hard furnishings with small black or dark brown splotches. Because bedbugs are very good at hiding, their existence is more often evidenced by these markings than by the actual bugs themselves, here is a classic example of bedbug faecal splotches on wood [https://anchorpestcontrol.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/How-to-Get-Rid-of-Bed-Bugs-and-Keep-Them-Out-2.png](https://anchorpestcontrol.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/How-to-Get-Rid-of-Bed-Bugs-and-Keep-Them-Out-2.png) and here is an example of what their markings look like on a mattress [https://www.planetnatural.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/early-signs-of-bed-bugs.png](https://www.planetnatural.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/early-signs-of-bed-bugs.png)\n\n**Smells:** Bedbugs and their infestations are also associated with certain smells because the animals signal to each other via pheromones which to the human nose often either smell like coriander or raspberries, so much so that in olden times bedbugs used to be called the *\"Coriander Bug\"*. When a full-blown bedbug infestation is in swing you will often smell either a strange musty berry-like sweet smell emanating from the room, a smell of coriander or an acrid almond-like smell (they can also make rooms smell like old bed linen in general).\n\n**Skins:** Bedbugs repeatedly shed their old skins as they grow larger and develop into adults. Finding evidence of light brown, translucent skins like these [https://njaes.rutgers.edu/bed-bug/images/Shed-skins-big.jpg](https://njaes.rutgers.edu/bed-bug/images/Shed-skins-big.jpg) is another common sign that a place has an infestation.\n\n**Blood:** Bedbugs typically only feed on people at night while they are asleep and then retreat before sunrise. They go for any exposed skin they can find and if you have been so unfortunate to sleep in a bed that has bugs then you might see small specks or splotches of red or dried blood on the sheets the next day like this: [https://bonaccordpestcontrol.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Signs-of-bed-bugs-red-bloodstains-on-sheets-1.jpg](https://bonaccordpestcontrol.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Signs-of-bed-bugs-red-bloodstains-on-sheets-1.jpg)\n\n**Bite Marks:** Bedbugs will typically bite in close patterns like this: [https://health.clevelandclinic.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/04/bedbugBites-656515070-770x553-2.jpg](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/04/bedbugBites-656515070-770x553-2.jpg) ) and the bites often display as larger than mosquito bites but unlike mosquito bites they don't always itch (and sometimes present as hive-like markings these: [https://cdn-prod.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/articles/318/318083/line-of-bedbug-bites-on-a-woman-s-back.jpg](https://cdn-prod.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/articles/318/318083/line-of-bedbug-bites-on-a-woman-s-back.jpg) ).\n\nOther signs of infestation:\n\n**Fumigation chemical smells:** We are experiencing bedbug problems because years of laws that reduced the arsenal of highly toxic (but also highly effective) pesticide chemicals meant that over time bedbug treatments became less effective and as bedbugs began to survive treatments, they evolved greater resistance to chemicals. This also means that if a place has been recently fumigated it might not be bedbug-free yet (in fact sometimes places are taking up to 2-3 treatments before they are completely free).  Although *Sulfuryl Fluoride* (the main ingredient in fumigation chemicals) is odorless, *Chloropicrin* (which smells sweet and is very acrid &amp; harsh to inhale) is added to fumigation mixes to help warn people from entering places that have been recently fumigated. If you suspect that you smell any lingering fumigation smells or see a place being fumigated, it is wise to avoid the whole site as treatments are not always proving effective against bedbug infestations.\n\nHow bedbugs transmit:\n\n**Luggage:** Unlike headlice or bodylice, bedbugs do not live on people's bodies. Instead, the most common way they get from one place to another is by hiding in the seams or gaps in or on people's luggage.\n\n**Clothing:** Bedbugs can also hide inbetween stacks of clothing inside people's luggage.\n\nSo, to round up, your plan of action when staying anywhere unfamiliar should be:\n\n1. **Smell:** Before you put your luggage down, smell the room: Does it smell like coriander, chemicals, old bed linen, musty raspberries or acrid almonds? If so, there could be bedbugs.\n2. **Mattress:** Check the mattress by lifting up the bed sheets and checking along the seams of the mattress for signs of bedbugs and their distinctive faecal patches.\n3. **Bedrame:** Check the bedframe by looking along the joins of the bedframe, behind the headboard and inside any cracks or splits in the wood for signs of bedbugs and their distinctive faecal patches.\n4. **Luggage:** Keep your luggage closed at night and ideally opt for hard-cased luggage bags over soft luggage bags.\n5. **Clothes:** Keep your clothes inside of re-sealable plastic bags.\n6. **Torch:** Pack a small flashlight in your luggage to make checking your room for bedbugs easier.\n7. **Floor:** Don't store your luggage on a carpeted floor, instead opt to store it on a smooth, flat raised surface.\n8. **Checks:** Before you leave your stay, take your luggage into the bathroom (where it is bright &amp; light), shake it out in the bath or shower area and inspect things like the pockets &amp; straps to make sure that no critters have hitched a ride. If you have access to a vacuum hoover, give the luggage a quick going over before you take it with you.\n9. **Ineffective:** Over-the-counter insect repellant sprays and insect killer sprays like Raid are all ineffective in strength against bedbugs and so inadvisable to spray on your luggage, self or clothes, which will unnecessarily expose you to toxic chemicals.\n10. **Home:** Once you get home, keep all your holiday clothes sealed in bags until they have all been washed &amp; laundered with detergents and vacuum hoover the luggage cases.\n11. **Scents:** Bedbugs are reported to not like the smells emitted by natural lavendar, citris fruits, cinnamon &amp; mint, so some people believe that if you make your luggage smell of these scents then it might help to deter bedbugs from hitching a ride on it.\n\nIf you suspect even the slightest bit that your room might have bedbugs in it, inform the manager straightaway and demand a new room; a hotel has absolutely no right to force you to sleep in or pay for any rooms which have bedbugs in them.\n\nThe strange behaviours of Paris's bedbugs:\n\n1. **Unusual places:** Bedbugs always used to be associated with bedrooms and luggage but in recent years there have been increasing reports of people seeing bedbugs in places such as cinema's and on public transport like the Metro systems carriage seats [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPjbn7DuWGY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPjbn7DuWGY)\n2. **No longer strictly nocturnal:** There have also been increasing reports of people witnessing bedbugs actively scuttling around during the daytime.\n\nSo it is advisable to not just exercise caution when staying in places like AirBnB's, hotels, student accomodation and hostels, but also in other public places that have soft furnishings such as seats on buses, trains, cinema's and tube carriages.\n\n*Edit: spelling*\n\n&amp;#x200B;","subreddit":"london","comments":823,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/16znhzx/frances_bedbug_epidemic_coming_to_london_and_how/","_row":"4"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-10","timestamp":1696916956,"title":"AITA for not \"saving\" my gf's drivers license and refusing to drive her to and from work?","text":"**I am NOT the Original Poster.

Always. No matter if it's 5 mins up the road or catching a plane.\n\nBefore we get into it, no she isn't on the autism spectrum, she doesn't have ADHD or time blindness.\n\nShe just DAWDLES. ALL. THE TIME.\n\nShe snoozes her alarm at least three times every morning, then lays there going through her social media.\n\nEventually she gets up and takes a long ass shower, dresses (Which takes her forever, and she usually sits wrapped in a towel on her phone), then lingers over her coffee. 9 times out of 10 she's running late for work, and ends up speeding to make it on time.\n\nNaturally, she's gotten a number of speeding tickets. I've tried to help her - eg putting her phone where she can't reach it from bed so she has to get up to snooze it, but she literally just grabs it and goes back to bed.\n\nYou try to get her to move her ass and she just digs in her heels and takes even longer. Her response to people calling out her lateness is \"better late than dead on time\".\n\nAnyway, again, she was running even later than normal for work, and really had to speed to make it. A week goes by and sure enough, massive speeding fine in the mail.\n\nShe now has to hand in her drivers license because she's got so many demerit points, she'll be without one for 6 months.\n\nInstead of just dealing with it, she TELLS me \"I'll need you to cop this one and say you were driving so I don't lose my license\" and of course, I refused, telling her she needs to live with the consequences of her actions and maybe she should stop speeding, and wake up earlier.\n\nThis argument went on for a few days until she finally conceded, then proceeds to tell me \"well, you'll have to drive me to and from work until I get my license back\", and I tell her I won't be doing that - her work is literally in another direction than my work is from home, and doing so would add another two hours of driving per day. She says it shouldn't matter as my work has flexible hours, but I stood my ground and refused, and said she can take public transport - there's literally a bus stop 2 mins walk from our house and the bus stops maybe 5 mins walk from her work, and it's quite regular,\n\nShe says she hates public transport and refuses to ride it, so I said then it's Uber for her, or organise a car pool, but bottom line, it's not my responsibility.\n\nShe called me an AH and is giving me the silent treatment, said a decent boyfriend would go to those lengths for her and that it's only 6 months.\n\nSo, am I AH for not \"saving her license\" and refusing to drive her to and from work for 6 months?\n\nTL,DR: Gf is always running late, speeds to work, gets caught, loses license, expects me to cop the blame so she can keep her license, I Refuse, she then expects me to drive her to and from work but it's literally out of my way, says I'm the AH.\n\nEDIT: We live in Brisbane, Australia for those wondering\n\n***OOP is voted NTA***\n\n**Update 1 in** [Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xln17/aita_for_not_saving_my_gfs_drivers_license_and/k36wnpu/?context=3)**: October 2, 2023 (Next Day)**\n\nADD: Wow! I wasn't expecting such a response, and definitely not everyone being on my side.\n\nShe told me all her friends think I'm TA, which is a big part of why I came here in the first place.

I pointed out to her this is not the first, or even the tenth time this has been brought up to her, and that I'm no longer happy in the relationship.

He told me my mother packed up and left us when I turned 2 years old.\n\nI grew up to resent and hate her. Mainly because I saw how my father was working super long hours to make ends meet. I hated how my grandma basically had to raise me.\n\nWhen I would ask her about my mother, my grandma painted a picture of a bitter, spiteful, hateful spoiled/ entitled woman. I felt very justified in my anger and hate for her. That's what my family told me and I had absolutely no reason to doubt them.\n\nA few weeks ago I found her on social media while at my boyfriend's house. And I was so.fucking.mad.She was out there living her best life. She is a cook ( chef?) in a Michelin star restaurant. She travels, has a huge apartment, and apparently is married to a gorgeous man.\n\nIn a fit of rage, I DM'd her cruising her out for abandoning me to live her frivolous life and that karma would come to her.\n\nShe obviously saw it. Instead of going off on me she just asked me to meet her and that she felt like I had a right to express my anger to her in person and that she owed me as much.I was starstruck because my father said she never stood for the consequences of her actions.\n\nWithout telling anyone I agreed. She invited me to this amazing restaurant. She paid an Uber for me and everything.\n\nIt was very awkward at the beginning. I kept berating her. I was so angry. I cried a little. She just sat there and took it all in. I then asked her...why she abandoned me.She then asked ( this is all paraphrased) \" Do you really want to know the whole story? It is not nice and you will not like it. I am ready to be the bad guy in your head forever and keep my distance.\"I just kept pressing her. And then she told me the real story. This is again paraphrased and to my best recollection.\n\nShe told me that my father and she met shortly before ending Uni. At that time my mother had said she did not want to stay in uni town.A few months after dating my father told her, that his landlord was evicting him because the apartment was needed for immediate family use. She offered him to stay while he found something else.\n\nMoths passed and he was not doing anything. Then she got a job offer in another country. She told my father, that he could take over her apartment or come with her. They had this huge fight where my mother told him that she was not ready for the type of commitment he wanted. She wanted different things in life than him and that as much as she loved him...that they weren't compatible.They stayed living together and then one day she found out she was pregnant. She told me honestly, that she was thinking of not having me. She did not feel ready to be a mom at 22. She did not feel maternal feelings. She said she was already struggling with depression and late-diagnosed ADHD.\n\nMy father convinced her to have me. He said he would take me because he had a right to me. That he would go after her because that baby was also his. So she had me.She said that the time after birth was really bad. My father was dragging out the legal procedures, he refused to vacate the home. My mother said that while she felt love for me and that there were moments when she felt overjoyed, it was overshadowed by huge waves of suicidal ideation. She was scared that she was gonna hurt me. She also showed me some of the court documents of that time that backed up her claims.\n\nIn the end, she was so desperate that she agreed to stay with my father if he agreed to be the main caretaker. He did but only half-assed. My mother then told me that it got so bad, that she tried to commit suicide around my second birthday after a particularly nasty fight where my father admitted to having tampered with her birth control. She showed me the papers of the involuntary 72 hours commitment and the legal documents where she was found unfit to be a parent afterwardI felt nauseous after all that. I would have not believed her, hadn't she brought so much \"evidence\" with her.\n\nShe then asked me what I meant in my message that we were struggling.I told her that we were not exactly rich and that I was struggling to come up with the money to go to University in another city. She was bewildered and asked me what my father had been doing with the monthly payments she was making.\n\nI told her that we don't receive that money. Then she took out another stack of papers. .... Guys.... she is sending child support every month. It is almost 3k every. month.Edit: She is court-mandated to pay me 1.5k. She doubled the payments out of her own will. She doesn't have to pay that amount. She wants to\n\nShe was very concerned about this and told me she would talk to her lawyers ASAP to transfer the money to me directly.In the end, she apologized to me. She is very sorry to have put me through this. She was very sorry for not being stronger and she was very sorry for letting me grow up the way I did. She was crying... I was crying.\n\nShe then told me to take my time. She would contact me again regarding the payments and that it was up to me if I wanted to see her again. That she couldn't be the mother i wanted but the least she could do is help me with anything that I need.I hugged her. I cried. She cried. I boxed up my food and she got me another uber home.At home, my father was not there. So I went straight to bed and left early the next morning and am staying with my boyfriend. My whole life is a lie.\n\n[Just found records of domestic violence from my father(42f) to my mother (40f). My(m18)life keeps crumbling.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vxk2nu/just_found_records_of_domestic_violence_from_my/) 12 July 2022\n\nI have found out that my mother never really abandoned me because she didn\\`t want me, but because she tried to commit suicide and was deemed unfit to parent and that my father basically baby trapped my mother with me.\n\nAfter the post yesterday, I went snooping even more because I do not trust my father anymore.I found records of domestic abuse perpetrated by my father toward my mother. He was charged but never ended up going to jail or did a very reduced sentence. This would have been when I was 2 after my mother was committed. I also found a Restraining Order filed by my mother against my father.It was so much worse than what she said. He did not only abuse her emotionally but also physically. I am feeling so disgusted. I could just scream.\n\nI returned to my boyfriend again. My father has been calling a lot asking why I had spent so much time away from home.RN my excuse is a family emergency of my boyfriend.After yesterday's I wanted to confront him but now I don't feel safe. Any advice?\n\n[Caught my father(m42) in a lie... should I(m18) just cut my losses and cut him off from my life?](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/vzs3z5/caught_my_fatherm42_in_a_lie_should_im18_just_cut/) 15 July 2022\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy life was put upside down for the past weeks.Tldr is that I found out my mother did not abandon me but tried to commit and was deemed an unfit parent due to her mental issues. She was giving my father 3k a month as child support. 1.5k was court-mandated 1.5k was out of her own will.I also found court records of my father being charged with physically assaulting my mother on more than one occasion.\n\nSo after staying for a while with my boyfriend, I decided to go home for a while because I wanted to get my legal documents and all of that. My father came back home and we talked a bit. I just asked him \" by the way.... did my mother never send you child support for me?\"My father just scoffed theatrically and went on this rant about how courts are always accessible to the mother and how they told him he couldn't expect anything from her and so on. He pulled that whole story of him begging her for money when he didn't have enough money for my school supplies and her turning him down.\n\nI know this is a lie. My mother kept itemized records of all her money wires to my father. every month since she had a job. meaning for over 15 years she has sent my father money. In the beginning, she sends him 400, then 600, then 1000, and eventually 3000.Then he kept talking saying how hard it was. That he wished he would have gone after her more. But that the courts were not in his favor. He told me how even now we were barely able to go paycheque to paycheque.\n\nHis rant was surreal.After he left to go god knows where I went snooping through his room where I found a stack of cash in his sock drawer. It was over 5k crammed into the back of his drawer.Things are getting worse. I feel so weird. I can not describe the ick. I have all my documents and wrote my mother so we could maybe meet again.Should I just ghost my father?\n\n[Update: I(m18) just found out that my father(m42) baby trapped my mother(f40) with me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/w8waj2/update_im18_just_found_out_that_my_fatherm42_baby/) 26 July 2022\n\nCAUTION VERY LONGWhat has happened in my other two posts?\n\nI found court documents that confirmed that my mother had been physically assaulted by my father. Upon further research, I determined that my father spent 3 months in jail for the assault. That was when I was 4 years old, which would explain why I do not remember anything at all about that.I met with him a few days ago. This is when I asked again about Child support. Posing the question like \" Hey dad, did my mother never give you any child support for me?\". He denied ever receiving Child support, citing that courts will go easy on women.\n\nThat same day I snooped around and found a stack of cash with over 5k in one of his drawers. I did have the data to the household account, but the 3k monthly payment was never figured in that account. Also, I scouted for withdrawals for more than 100 dollars at a time that maybe could explain the 5k stack ( which was only composed of 100-dollar bills). Nada.Some background\n\nUntil posting here, I never realized that my relationship with my father was not normal. I explain more about his behavior in the previous, but as a bit of an explanation :He made me his \"accountant\" from a very young age. I had to keep track of expenses etc. And so many times I was having panic attacks because we would not make it to the end of the month with the money on the account. So many times my father would berate me if I ever asked to go out (e.g to the cinema) because we couldn't afford it.\n\nWhen he would allow me to go out it was always attached to an endless list of requirements that were absurd. Again let's take the example of the cinema. I would ask him a week prior and he'd say yes but that I had to clean the house, drive grandma to the doctor, pick up xy, Leave some dinner ready for me, and many more. So that if I did not complete one single detail ( like not bringing out the trash) he would pick up a fight with me making me feel guilty and thus staying home.\n\nHe would constantly make me feel worthless. Saying I would not survive in uni, that I was not talented to do this, that I was not good enough to do that.He is extremely reactive. one time in the car I teased him that I would be for the other football( soccer) team tonight and he kicked me out of the car making me walk home alone.There are so many more examples. I thought it was merely my fault or that other dad were also like this. But suffice to say... it is not normal.\n\nWhat happened now?I did in fact contact my mother after finding all this out.I \"confronted\" her with the newfound information. She admitted that it was quite bad and she did fear for her life. My father apparently had friends in law enforcement that were following my mother and making her life impossible ( giving her tickets for the most inconsequential stuff, pulling her over for random \"controls\") everything possible to intimidate her or to find dirt on her.\n\nMy father put her to the ultimatum of just singing over without a fight or he would make her any my life impossible. My mother told me that he had been abusing her since I was born. As early as one-week postpartum. So when my father uttered the ultimatum she felt hopeless and just tried to end it.It did not work and after she was released my father served her and battled for full custody. Because she was deemed unfit to parent it was really easy for him. She told me the court actually went pretty hard on her.\n\nAbout a year after that my mother attempted to establish visitation with me. She reached out to my father who invited her over. He told her that she could be in my life if she agreed to be together with him again. My mother told him no and then a fight ensued. That was the night he assaulted her. He assaulted her so badly that she wound up in the hospital. In the hospital seeing her wounds they had to report it. So he was sentenced to a year but only served 3 months.At that time custody of me was with my grandmother. My father resumed custody of me at the time of being release.\n\nI was able to corroborate all this after reaching out to my aunt who has not spoken to our family in 10 years. My aunt Mia basically documented my mother's abuse. She took pictures of her bruises, and recordings of my father screaming and threatening her. She told me that she testified against my father in court and that she could just back up everything my mother said because he was the same to her.\n\nI insisted on seeing the pictures and recordings. My aunt was resistant to this. But apart of me did not want to accept that this was reality. So yeah... my father is a fucking monster.I told my mother about everything monetarily that I had found out. She said that legally there was not much we could do. But she spoke with her lawyer and seeing as I am 18 she started the motion to start transferring me my Child support money. She said that for the time being she would give me 1.5k monthly while she still had to pay my dad the money. As soon as the process is greenlit I am going to get it all. She also agreed to pay for my Matriculation fees as well as for the deposit and first month's rent of an apartment in my uni town so that I could be as independent as possible. For now, I have only sent in my applications a couple of weeks ago, so I should get any news on that front latest by September. We decided that confronting my father was not a good idea. For neither of us.\n\nSo we decided on telling my father that my boyfriend's parents invited me to vacation. But he does not know I am gay. So we plan on telling him that this is the last vacation to say goodbye to my friend.I have talked to my boyfriend and his parents. They did not even hesitate and immediately said yes. They now know everything and support me 100 percent. So my mother and his parents are sending us for 2 weeks to a nearby country where they have a summer house.\n\nI told my father about the plans and he said that as long as his parents were paying that it was alright. He did tell me that I had to help him with a million things before leaving again. So I am already seeing a fight on the horizon.But I have managed to get all my important documents and open a bank account thanks to my Aunt's help.\n\nSo on Thursday, I am officially leaving for 2 weeks and I pray things to get resolved beforehand. I am taking all important stuff with me already in case things go south fast.\n\nAnyways. This has been an extremely difficult time. And I feel overwhelmed with this all.\n\nSo please don't reach out probing me for an Update. I will update when I feel it is right and when i feel like I can do it. This has been very helpful. Without you guys, I would have never noticed that I had also been abused and that there is most likely more to the story. Even more than what I have found out. It has also proven very therapeutic to write this all down in a somewhat orderly fashion. So thank you so much for all the support and advice.\n\n[NEW UPDATE: I(m18) just found out that my father(m42) baby trapped my mother(f40) with me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/wrvcjj/new_update_im18_just_found_out_that_my_fatherm42/)18 August 2022\n\nI AM NOT IN THE US. Don't speculate with US laws and standards. They do not apply\n\nI am the original OP. I saw that u/alejamix had posted a recompilation of my posts on this sub and I figured this is the best way to reach out to all of you who have written me and are curious as to what is happening.\n\nThis is the link to the original threat here with all the older UpdatesThings went south fast.\n\nThe Wednesday night, the night before I left, my father picked up a fight with me for not taking his car for an oil change. He called me everything under the sun. Saying I am selfish and a brat, that he raised me better.\n\nHe then had my grandmother come and say how disappointed they were. That I was clearly not mature enough to leave for a Holliday, let alone move away for university. They held me awake till 4 am under the guise of a family meeting, which was basically just a reprimanding session of all I had done wrong in my life.\n\nAnd to be honest... I was demoralized. I was ugly crying and feeling awful. Thankfully my boyfriend called because I had not answered several texts of his. He helped me transport all my stuff while my father was sleeping.And I left without telling him bye. He texted me around 1 pm and my father was acting like everything was normal.\n\nSo the two weeks passed very quickly. I got a mail that I got into a university that has a very good program for political science. So I accepted and put myself on the waiting list for University accommodation.\n\nThen shit blew up. My mother suddenly stopped giving my father half the money. So she was only paying what she was legally obligated to pay. My father was losing it. He began calling screaming at me to come home at once. Then calling me crying to tell me that the bitch of my mother had reappeared and was suing him (?) and now we did not have enough money to pay for the mortgage.\n\nI called my mother to ask if she was actually suing him. She said no and said that she had just gone through the courts to start paying me directly instead of my father, which was granted.Then my grandma started texting me. Saying I had to come home right away because my father had had a cardiac arrest.\n\nObviously, I went back home with my boyfriend. Only to find our house in literal shambles. There were beer cans, string liquor stuff, and cigarettes everywhere.\n\nEveryone that was betting that my father was using all the money on drugs and lavish stuff.... hey... congratulations... You were right.\n\nApparently when I left my father decided to have a huge party. He invited all these friends that he made in fancy bars. I know that because the lady that was in the hospital with my dad, his GF apparently. She did not know about me, she kept talking about our house as his \"summer residence\". I asked her a few questions. She answered. She is actually pretty sweet but put off by my father now that she knows how he lied.\n\nSo apparently my father would take the 3k and spend them almost fully on appearing to be richer. He had bought some clothing pieces that were high quality. He would hang out in these fancy hotel sky lounges where he met his GF. Then would take her and her friends out to expensive restaurants and clubs. She did not fully admit it but insinuated that they did coke often during those outings. Much like the party that leads my dad to OD. It was not only cocaine that they did. I also think an amphetamine?Anyway, I thanked her and told her that the money was not my father's and she had been lied to. She stayed till my father came to and we could bring him home. Which is when she dumped him.\n\nAnd then I broke it to him. I was leaving. He lost his shit. He punched me. He broke my nose. I was really afraid. He was not even fully recovered.\n\nIn the hospital, I told the nurse how it happened and the police got involved.\n\nMy mother took me in the very next day. She is helping me with all the legal things regarding my father. She helped me move out. Helped me move cities. it all happened very very fast. My boyfriend has been staying over because i am very afraid.\n\nMy father has been blocked but I have been getting threatening emails.So that is that. It is good and bad\n\nEDIT TO ANSWER FAQ:Why did my mother not take me in if my father was so abusive?I explained it already in the last posts. But Tldr. she had lost her rights due to her trying to commit suicide. It did not get better as my father and his friends in law enforcement and the judges in our small town are heavily biased toward against women.\n\nhow did you stumble upon so many documents so conveniently?I didn't. I very sought out those documents. I reached out to Mia myself and insisted in her showing me what she had. None of this was perchance. I have sought out every single document. They are available to the public. Plus if you know what you are looking for you will find them easily by going through your parents' files. This was not convenient. This was hard work\n\nIf you are 18 why is your mom still paying CS?Here you are legally entitled to CS and governmental CS till you finish University or/and till you reach your 25th birthday.\n\nAre you gonna sue your father for back payment?No. That would not be of any help. It would be extremely hard to prove that he blew it all. In the end, I was fed and clothed and I had a place to stay with heat, electricity and internet, and running water. It would take too long and not be good for anything but revenge. My mother is terrified of him and I am not keen on seeing him.\n\nWe are gonna pursue a restraining order and are documenting all his Mails and contact attempts. Someone pointed out to keep an eye out for my father opening accounts or credits in my name. We are looking into protecting ourselves in that area.Get a firearmNo. It is not legal nor makes any sense\n\nHow come your mother had a lawyer on retainer so conveniently?She didn't. My first post was well over a month ago. My mother reached out to a lawyer shortly after to transfer my CS from my father directly to me in a very clean-cut way. Since then that lawyer has recommended us to another firm that is taking my/ our case.Everything about school and University:\n\nI am not on a waiting list for what I am gonna study. I am on a waiting list for the dorm. Till then I am staying with my BF in a long-term Airbnb in the city.School starts in October, not next week. Again I DO NOT LIVE IN THE US.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Update post for you guys](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/y0izxm/update_post_for_you_guys/)10 October 2022, \n\nThe post was deleted but the publication was rescued in a comment\n\nI am Alex's Boyfriend.

He had brutally attacked me because I was going to leave him and the CS checks that he had been blowing on drugs and women, would stop with my departure.Last year my whole world crumbeled, when I found out that my mother had not left us. My father had abused her and made it impossible for her to take me.\n\nHe has made my life absolutley misserable. I have detailed this over the past few months here.After I was let out of the hospital, my mother and I got 2 amazing lawyers. One for the assault case and the other for the misappropriation of the money.\n\nThe process for the CS case was quick. He had to pack back 50% of the money given to him in the past 3 years to me directly. No further fines.However... the assault case spiraled. It was found out that he was going to attempt to plead not guilty in the case of temporary insanity. He had detailed his plan to get away with this to his gf. Who is not an awful human and showed the police what she had.\n\nSo it went from assault to attempted murder.\n\nWith his gf leaving him, him owing a bunch of money, looking at a hefty prison sentence, and no more money to bail himself out... he took his life on Friday.I was numb the whole week. But today the realization washed over me... I am finally free. I don't have to look over my shoulder, I don't flinch when I hear steps, I don't have anxiety while checking my phone.\n\nI am free.

They will argue for reasons why they should be allowed to inconvenience other people and others will agree. \n\nPeople don't give anyone else the benefit of the doubt. Nor do they go out of their way to be polite. Where I live for example, we used to be known for how politely and efficiently we queue and get on public transport. Now, people will push ahead of others or just stand in the way, not paying attention to anything but themselves. Even when it's not busy, people just do their own thing, taking their sweet time to get on or off, standing in the way even when there's free space. God forbid they should have to walk an extra step to make it easier for other passengers. \n\nAnd what I find insufferable personally, is how *loud* everyone is. People yell over each other. People play music in public on their phone. People are on speakerphone in public. In my apartment building, people blare music and yell in the fucking *hallways*. I'm not an advocate for being seen and not heard, but surely there's a middle ground between silence and having to hear your second-hand YouTube video in the grocery store. \n\nThis whole century of the self has led to selfishness and a serious lack of sympathy for and interest in other humans in the West. Even listening to how people date these days, they don't seem to care about what they can do for their partners. They want people to impress them instead. Everyone thinks they're better than everyone else and more deserving of special treatment. \n\nI know I sound old, but I truly feel that there's less everyday courtesy and in my opinion, it's because here in the West we get bombarded with the message that were all unique and special and amazing. \n\nAnd I agree. Everyone is. But that means we should all care a lot more about each other and try to help each other live better instead of competing for space and attention. There's room for being unique and special AND being kind, generous, and courteous. \n\nAnyway. This will probably be removed.\n\nEdit: individualism is not just being an individual. It is an ethic that puts the individual before the collective. I am aware that we can all be unique, amazing people and that having a sense of self doesn't make somebody bad. I chose my words carefully. \n\nAnd what most of you think you're correcting me about is self-esteem. They are two different things. You can have no self-esteem and still be an individualist, or you can think you're the best human to have ever existed and still follow collectivism.","subreddit":"unpopularopinion","comments":665,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/177iv6e/individualism_is_leading_to_the_death_of_courtesy/","_row":"7"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-24","timestamp":1695583161,"title":"Awesome advice!","text":"","subreddit":"WhitePeopleTwitter","comments":116,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/16r65cu/awesome_advice/","_row":"8"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-22","timestamp":1697950318,"title":"AITA for making my partner's daughter use my period underwear?","text":"My partner and I live together and his daughters \"Leah\" (11f) and \"Rachel\" (8f) were staying with us. It was school holidays a few weeks ago in our country - I work from home so the girls were with me during the day.\n\nDuring the school holidays, Leah got her first period. But the problem was, we didn't have pads at home. We have tampons for guests, and I use a menstrual cup/period underwear. I didn't think getting Leah to use tampons right away was a good idea - it was her first period, she's still young, and I also felt like it would be overstepping if I taught Leah how to use a tampon without permission from her parents.\n\nMy partner was in a meeting, so his phone was on do not disturb and he didn't see my call/message until a few hours later. I don't have their mum's contact. This led to another problem - in our country, you can't leave kids alone until they're 14. I don't have a car, and I don't feel comfortable taking the two kids anywhere on public transport without their parents being aware (especially when one of them bled through her pants).\n\nIn that situation - I decided to let Leah use my period underwear. It was a little big for her, but it was thoroughly cleaned and dried. Not sure if relevant, but I've only used the underwear once - I'm on birth control and get my period less than once a year. I thought this was the best solution until my partner picks up some pads on his way home. Aside from assuring Leah that the bleeding was normal, I waited for my partner to get home and discuss with his ex-wife how to give Leah \"the period talk\".\n\nMy partner has no issues with how I handled it, but his ex-wife, on the other hand, did not react well at all. She said I treated Leah like a \"second-class citizen\" because I gave her my used underwear, and she wants to change the current custody arrangement (from 50/50 to 90/10) because my presence would harm the girls. She also said the fact that we didn't keep pads at home shows that we are unequipped to parent the girls.\n\nMy partner has my back - he said he would have done exactly what I did and continues to defend me. But I see that he is heartbroken, his ex-wife has engaged her lawyer (and he's engaged his lawyer too), but he is scared that he will lose custody of his daughters, or that this would affect his relationship with his daughters. But was I the asshole? Was giving Leah my underwear inappropriate? Open to your thoughts, I would like to learn from this so I can be a better step-parent figure to the girls.\n\n-\n\nUpdate: thank you everyone for your feedback! I woke up to hundreds of new comments. I read them this morning, but won\u0019t be able to respond to each one.\n\nLots of you asked why I don\u0019t have the ex\u0019s number. There\u0019s only been a handful of times my partner left the girls alone with me. The girls don\u0019t live in our house - partner and ex rents house just for the girls and they switch living at the girls\u0019 house every week. The girls were here because I can look after them during school holidays (instead of sending them to holiday club etc). It\u0019s just never occurred to us I might need to contact the ex directly.\n\nThe ex and I also never got along because there\u0019s a big age gap between me and my partner. I met my partner in my mid-20s (he was in his late 30s), and it\u0019s been a few years but the ex still isn\u0019t comfortable with the age gap. She called me a gold digger, broke a paper mache bedside table I spent a month making for the girls, broke my violin strings the day of a concert I was performing at (all within the first month of meeting me). It got better for a while, we were cordial and respectful in front of the kids. But after an incident I mentioned in the comments, it declined again. If I wore a hoodie at home for example, she\u0019d ask my partner \u001care you sure she\u0019s old enough to take care of our girls?\u001d I\u0019ve always kept my distance - but I think the age gap is potentially what has made her wanted full custody the whole time.","subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","comments":1470,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17dli1t/aita_for_making_my_partners_daughter_use_my/","_row":"9"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-07","timestamp":1696651218,"title":"AITA for not allowing my mother to bring her boyfriend I don't know or want to know to my wedding?","text":"**I am NOT OOP.

She divorced my dad (60) when I was 7 and almost immediately married my stepfather \"Mark\" whom despite everything, I was close with. They remained married until I was 16. I was upset when she divorced him and went to live with my dad and stepmom. In my adult life, I've chosen to remain close to my stepdad and even attended his wedding to his current wife, who is a very nice woman. My dad and my stepmom are great people.\n\nSince her divorce to my stepdad, my mom has been in and out of relationships, each time claiming this guy is the love of her life until they do something she doesn't like and they aren't the love of her life anymore. Both divorces with my dad and my stepdad were for very petty reasons (dad, I think because he wouldn't allow her to get a new car because the budget was tight). I think the one that lasted the longest was 6 years and I think it's the current guy she's with, according to my sister. After I left home, she never did anything with me without her boyfriends. When I was 25, she broke up with her boyfriend and tried to cry to me about it. After working with my therapist, I set the boundary with my mother that if she wasn't willing to do anything with me without her boyfriend to not bother and I didn't want to talk about her love life. She was very hurt and we fell out for awhile but she came back around about a year later and has respected my rule since but we only get together about 3 or 4 times per year. I understand that my mom's relationships and love life are important to her so I respect that we don't get together often.\n\nFast forward to this year, I'm getting married to my partner (35M) of a decade in October. It's a small intimate backyard wedding and reception/bbq. We live in a rural area and our backyard wedding will have roughly 40 people. My dad, stepmom, stepdad and his new wife have all been invited. My mom asked if she could bring her boyfriend, I said no because I don't know him. My mom asked if she could bring him to meet me so I could meet him before the wedding. I said no and that I still had no interest in meeting her boyfriends. She said she understood but she felt it was unfair that I wasn't allowing her a +1 to my wedding when my dad and my stepdad were allowed to bring their spouses. I told her that the difference was that I knew their spouses. She wanted to know why I was so adamant about refusing to get to know her boyfriend. I explained to her that I saw no need since she'd just break up with them and move on to someone else eventually as she has always done before. She started to cry and told me I was being unreasonable and treating her as if she's a wh**e.\n\nBoth my fiance and my sister feel like I should suck it up for one day and let her bring her boyfriend so she can be comfortable there. I'm seriously considering it but I wanted to know if I'm TA here for sticking to my boundary at my wedding and what your thoughts are.\n\nUPDATE: After reading everything here, I've decided to email my mother and invite him. I was already leaning towards telling her that he can come when I posted. I decided to set some ground rules for my mother:\n\n1. He is there as a +1 to my mother only. I made it clear to her that he is not my family and he is not my stepfather so I will appreciate her not telling other people at the wedding he is my stepfather. Mark is my stepfather and he will be there.\n\n2. He is not to be in any family photos (in fairness, my stepdad Mark won't be in any family photos either, only my mom, dad, stepmom, and my siblings).\n\n3. He is not to approach me at any point during the wedding and reception.\n\n4. This does not change my previous boundaries. I'm only allowing him to come for her own comfort and to create a sense of fairness. I respect the fact she is in a relationship but that her love life has nothing to do with me and I wish to keep it that way.\n\n5. I told my mother that these are my terms for him being at my wedding and my terms are final and that I hope she can respect the fact that I'm trying to be reasonable. I used this opportunity to remind her the reasons I put the boundary up in the first place. These reasons included forcing me to do activities with her shorter term boyfriends in the past, forcing me to only discuss her love life while showing no interest in my life, and putting her relationships above her own children.\n\nIf she responds, I'll let everyone know.\n\nUpdate 2: My mom called me within 10 minutes of getting the email. She thanked me for allowing him to come and said they would abide by my terms. She said she felt really hurt that during her actions during her \"mid-life crisis\" are why I'm refusing to meet her current boyfriend (who she says she's been with for 7.5 years) and that she thought things would eventually calm down enough where I would be comfortable meeting him. She said she now realizes that it will never happen. I told her that I'm firm on my stance. I think she started to cry but she said she understood and only wants him there because being around my dad and stepdad and their \"new\" wives (my dad has been married for 23 years and my stepdad for 12) makes her anxious and he helps keep her calm. She said she respects my stance and said it's her own fault I feel this way. I felt this may be the start of a guilt trip so I politely ended the call.\n\n**VERDICT: NOT THE ASSHOLE**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Additional comments to the post from OOP:**\n\n&gt;**OP:** \n&gt;Update: I will update here since mods told me I was maxed on my post.\n&gt;\n&gt;I want to thank everyone here for commenting and giving their opinions. Without context, I think it's a little hard to understand why I'm the way I am towards my mother. This past has given me a chance to reflect on my own behavior towards my mother. The truth of it is, I find dealing with her to be exhausting and I want to explain to everyone why.\n&gt;\n&gt;1) My mom is a gold digger. And that isn't my dad or stepdad talking shit about my mom. They're classy guys and would never do that. This is my own conclusion. My mom said regarding both divorces \"I'd still be married if [dad or stepdad] just gave me what I wanted.\" She's also tried to start fights with my stepmom because she realizes my brother and I prefer her over our actual mom. It's true, I'm closer with my stepmom. I go to her for all the mom things because she listens and cares. My stepmom doesn't make every thing about her. I believe my mom suffers from main character syndrome and expects to be the center of attention at every event and if she isn't, she gets drunk which leads me to my next point...\n&gt;\n&gt;2) My mom is an alcoholic. She was in a DUI 8 years ago and crashed into another car. Thank goodness no one was hurt. She doesn't drive anymore, lives in the city an hour away, and uses public transportation. But she still drinks a lot, at her height, she drank roughly 3 bottles of wine per day. I don't really know or care if it's more or less now. One of the other boundaries I set is I won't be around her if she's been drinking because that just stresses me out more. I'll be honest, I'm anticipating she's going to cause a drunken scene at my wedding.\n&gt;\n&gt;3) She slept with my brother's best friend 8 years ago when they were 21. This was a boy who my brother had known since pre-school and this ruined the friendship. 8 years on and my brother will never forgive her for it. My mom thinks my brother needs to get over himself and that she did nothing wrong. Technically speaking, she didn't do anything illegal and everyone was a consenting adult but it still felt so wrong that she slept with someone my brother was so close with. It's why I don't really want my partner around her. She dates younger guys. This current boyfriend is 10 years younger than her, which is a little better. I don't judge her for dating younger guys, that's okay. It's not okay to sleep with someone you watched grow up.\n&gt;\n&gt;This whole post helped me see just how exhausted I am by her. I realized I don't want to deal with her BS anymore. I also agree that I have maybe at times shown it by being TA and being unfair and unreasonable towards her. I just don't like myself when dealing with her. It puts me in a bad mood. However, the idea of having her more in my life makes me nauseous but I want to keep the peace with the larger family (grandparents, aunt, uncle, etc.). I've decided to take a page from my youngest brother's book and keep contact to just family functions. He's cordial to her at family events and keeps the peace when he's around her but he keeps his distance and won't see her outside of a family event. So I'm going to do the same. I realized she could get sober, go to therapy, and change her entire life around but I'm still going to see the woman who drinks all the time, sleeps with my brother's friend and just treats people like garbage. It's not fair to anyone; not me for having dealt with her, and not her if she ever did or was actively working hard to change her life. I do want to make sure she's taken care of, fine, and healthy but I also want to not be emotionally involved anymore. Figuring that out is above Reddit's paygrade.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Relevant Comments from OOP:**\n\n***Resident_Test_2107:** Honestly I think you need to distinguish the hurt you felt as a kid when she broke up with your 2 father figures from what would happen now if they broke up. You are an adult, not a kid. Her break ups are her business, and don\u0019t impact you directly. Expecting someone to come to a wedding with her two exes there with their new wives is ALOT. Expecting her to suck it up to put you first feels like you are trying to play out some drama and feelings you have left over from feeling hurt/abandoned as a kid by her breaking up your home. Divorce happens, it sucks for the kids but so does an unhappy marriage. Feels like time to go back to therapy*\n\n&gt;**OP:** In my early 20s, she used to call me whenever she had a breakup and expected my sister and me to be emotionally supportive. She wouldn't spend time with me without her bfs around. She was insisting I meet some guy (who typically is a lot younger than her, like late 20s, or early 30s which good on her but still weird for me) she was dating for a few weeks. They'd break up after a year and she'd immediately find someone new. Wash. Rinse. Repeat. This was the pattern from when I was 19-25. I always had to spend time with both of them. All she would talk about is her relationship. She would never ask me about school, my job or my relationship. She's only met my partner twice. There's a lot more I can add about how my mom constantly prioritized her relationships over being a parent but they aren't pertinent to this story.\n&gt;\n&gt;She got with a really toxic guy when I was 24 who stole a bunch of money from her. We all warned her he was a scumbag but she didn't listen. After that, I told her I wanted nothing to do with her boyfriends going forward. She got really mad saying I was disrespectful and that any child should want to see her mother happy. But I just got tired of dealing with her relationship drama and I don't ever want to deal with it again. I'm sure the guy she's with is nice since he's been around this long but I'm just done.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[**I don't want to be around my mother but I want to be around family**](https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/163omu4/i_dont_want_to_be_around_my_mother_but_i_want_to/) - **August 28, 2023 (Five days later)**\n\nI posted last week in r/AmItheAsshole and I got some personal messages telling me I should check out this forum.\n\nI've decided to estrange myself from my mother. We haven't gotten along since I was 16 and the last several years have been really bad. We only get together about 2-4 times per year and it always ends with us fighting. I'm tired of it. I'll be honest. I've considered many times cutting contact with her but the one thing that's preventing me from fully severing ties is her parents - my grandparents. I love them very much and they are still hurting from my brother choosing to sever ties with her and keeping in low contact with that side of the family. My brother had valid reasons for doing this to her and he will get together with my grandparents if my mother isn't there but it's hard because they want to see him at the holidays and during special moments. I'm getting married in Oct and this will be the 1st event where my mom and brother are in the same area (I've told both of them to stay away from each other but I'm anticipating there will be drama because my mom doesn't like to hear she can't do something).\n\nI want to make it so we can see each other and be cordial at family events but not hang out otherwise. My youngest brother does something similar. I don't want to write her a letter because I fear that will cause more drama but I expect she'll eventually call and want to do something with me but I want to say no unless it's at a larger family function.\n\nHow should I do this?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[**My mother thinks she's entitled to alcohol at my wedding**](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/16qavjn/my_mother_thinks_shes_entitled_to_alcohol_at_my/) - **September 23, 2023 (A month later)**\n\nMy fiance (35M) and I 33(NB) are getting married in two weeks in our backyard. We will be having a catering spead for our reception afterwards. We decided to have a dry wedding for two reasons: my mom is an alcoholic who is known for making a scene when she gets drunk and my fiance has a brother who binge drinks and has had alcohol poisoning on more than one occasion (he doesn't drink all the time but if he starts he can't stop until he either passes out or someone physically restrains him from getting more). I also have an Uncle (mom's brother) and a stepdad who are in recovery and don't need the temptation. Neither fiance and I are big drinkers so we decided to just avoid any problems and just have a dry wedding. We will will have a less dry reception party/honeymoon with some our friends later on. All of our families have been supportive, my uncle was especially grateful to us for doing this since he takes his recovery very seriously and has been 7 years sober. I sent out wedding invitations 4 months ago and said it would be a dry wedding and asked people not to bring alcohol.\n\nNow today I get this call from my mom, who I also sent an invitation to 4 months ago:\n\nMom: Is it true you're not having alcohol at your wedding?\n\nMe: Yes. Fiance and I decided we didn't want alcohol during our special time.\n\nMom: That's so silly. It's going to make your wedding boring.\n\nMe: Well, I'm sorry you feel that way but [fiance] and I have made our decision. We want everyone to feel comfortable at our wedding.\n\nMom: Clearly, you don't care about my comfort! What if I want to have a little drink to pass the time?\n\nMe: Like you did at [A different Uncle]'s wedding where you got so drunk and made a horrible scene calling [Uncle]'s wife a golddigger?\n\nMom: It wasn't my fault! They made the drinks there too strong.\n\nMe: Right...I really wish you would address this need to have alcohol wherever you go.\n\nMom: I don't NEED to have alcohol. I just think your wedding will be boring without it. You want to have a fun wedding, don't you?\n\nMe: It will be a fun wedding. We don't need alcohol to have fun.\n\nMom: This is so stupid. Why should everyone else be punished just to make it comfortable for a few people? It seems like you care more about [Uncle] and [Stepdad] than anyone else.\n\nMe: Or maybe I just want to avoid any scenes.\n\nMom: I JUST TOLD YOU, THAT WASN'T MY FAULT!\n\nMe: Just like your DUI isn't your fault?\n\nMom: How DARE you bring up that difficult time in my life. I was going through a lot emotionally. What the hell is wrong with you kids?! You need to mind your own business. If I want to drink, that's my business!\n\nMe: Well my wedding is my business. We do not want alcohol there. That's final. I can't stop you if you decide to pre-game my wedding but I've already made it clear to [uncles and brothers] that if you cause a scene, that you are to be made to leave.\n\nMom (starts crying): Why do you kids hate me so much? What did I ever do to deserve to be treated like this by my children?\n\nMe: Are you really ready for me to go down that list?\n\nMom: None of you understand! None of you will ever understand! I'm the mother of the bride, I should be treated better than this.\n\nMe: I think I've treated you pretty well during this process. I've acquiesced to your boyfriend whom I don't even know coming to my wedding. I've even given in to some of your other demands. So please tell me how you've been mistreated?\n\nMom: You didn't invite me to go dress shopping! The mother of the bride always goes dress shopping with her daughter. I barely know [fiance] because you never bring him around me. How do I know that you're marrying the right person?\n\nMe: That's because [Aunt] made my dress.\n\nMom (sarcastically): Well isn't that just special...\n\nMe (sighing): As for the rest, I think you know why. We aren't really close enough for you to have any say in who my significant other is. Honestly mom, I'm done with this conversation. If you really feel that strongly about this, I'll understand if you don't want to attend my wedding.\n\nMom: OH I bet you'd like that wouldn't you? One way or another you will respect me as your mother!\n\nMe: Sure, mom. I'm hanging up now. Bye.\n\nGuys, I'm so livid right now. I have half a mind to uninvite her. I spoke to my dad and her brother. My uncle thinks her drinking is getting really bad again and has been wanting to hold an intervention. I told him I'm focused on the wedding right now but that I definitely agree this was out of line and something needs to be done.\n\nWhat do I do? I don't want her ruining my wedding but I'm so tired of dealing with this. Sorry this is probably above Reddit's pay grade but I just needed to vent.\n\nUpdate: I sent a text reiterating the rules. She said she knows where she isn't welcome and said she won't attend. My dad told me not to worry about this anymore and that he'll see to it she doesn't ruin my wedding.\n\nUpdate 2: I sent this text to my mom:\n\nMother, At this point I'm going to officially uninvite you from my wedding. I'm not going to allow you to change your mind and I'd prefer it if you not come to my wedding at all given your poor behavior. At this point, I've decided I don't want any further contact with you unless you decide to curb your toxic behaviors and drinking. I wish you the best, I hope you can find a way to heal but I can't do this anymore. I'm sorry if this hurts you but I can't handle you in my life anymore. If you try to force the issue, I'll be forced to take legal action up to and including contacting law enforcement. Please don't contact me again.\n\nI went to delete her from my Facebook page only to find a post that she had just written saying how being a mother is a thankless job and how she doesn't understand how she raised rude and judgemental kids. She ended it by saying she hopes her kids get over themselves someday. I'm done. This sucks but it's been a long time coming. My head hurts.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Relevant Comments from OOP:**\n\n***HawthorneUK:** I'd lay down the law with her, and uninvite her if she won't accept that she needs to be sober while she's there.*\n\n*Have somebody who is willing and able to eject her if (when) she sneaks alcohol in and gets drunk anyway.*\n\n&gt;**OP:** That's what I'm thinking. Her own brothers are saying they will eject her if she even causes a scene. My youngest uncle (whose wedding she ruined by causing a scene) made me a vow that he will not allow what happened at his wedding to happen at mine.\n&gt;\n&gt;My brothers (her own kids) despise her so they said if she even breathes wrong they will make sure she leaves.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n***One_Strain_2531:** Honestly best bet is pack a suitcase of her stuff and drive her to a rehab place. She clearly has a drinking problem and tries to gaslight others into believing she doesn't have a problem. If she doesn't get better in or after rehab then you might have to go low or no contact with her. Sorry*\n\n&gt;**OP:** She had to spend a year in rehab due to her DUI and the property damage she caused. It had no effect. I've decided to cut her from my life.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n[**Small update**](https://www.reddit.com/user/throwaway4meeeeeee86/comments/16r0vet/small_update/) - **September 24, 2023 (One day later)**\n\nFirstly, I want to thank everyone for the support. You have no idea how much your love and constructive comments mean to me. I'm glad I'm not alone.\n\nIt's not a huge update. But I guess my grandparents and uncles have had enough. They've decided to stage an intervention next weekend. If she refuses to get help, she will no longer be welcomed at family events and she will no longer be part of the family. They told me not to worry about it. My sister will go as she's the only one of her children that even has a real relationship with her but even my sister said that if she doesn't get help, she will cut her off too. I'm hoping and praying this works but given that she spent 1 year in rehab and the second she was off probation chose to drink again doesn't give me a lot of hope.\n\nMy dad told me he's hiring the local biker gang to act as security. We live in a small town and the nearest big city is about an hour away so it would really expensive to have a security company come out. I don't have a problem with that. This is the type of gang that helps out abused kids and animals and they do a lot of good where I live. The worst I've heard about them is they doled out some rural justice to a guy that was beating up the sister of one of the members and ran him out of town. When my mom got her DUI, she ran into someone's house and car (when she tried to back out, no one was hurt, thank goodness) and I guess it was the house of a relation of someone in the gang so they agreed to help and my dad is paying them to be security just in case. They know my family (one of my dad's cousins is a member) and they know my mom (I think she dated a guy in the gang at one point) and what to look out for. It may be moot if she ends up in rehab.\n\nI'm not stressing about her anymore. I have 13 days until my wedding. I'm going to focus on the final touches and just enjoy myself. My biological mom made her choices. Now that I've stood up for myself, I feel nothing but relief. My stepmom will be there and I see her more as my \"real\" mom so it's all fine. I've been through a lot of therapy already so I've had to make peace with how my actual mother is.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[**I'm officially estranged from my mother**](https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/16r170y/im_officially_estranged_from_my_mother/) - **September 24, 2023 (Same day, fifteen minutes later on a different sub from \"Small Update\")** \n\nWell it happened yesterday. I got into a fight with my mother and officially estranged myself from her. It sucks and I had a gnarly headache when I was done. Her drinking and behavior just proved too much and I had to univite her from my wedding.\n\nI feel sad it came to this but the most powerful feeling I have is relief.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[**Update: My mother thinks she's entitled to alcohol at my wedding**](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/16wdimk/update_my_mother_thinks_shes_entitled_to_alcohol/) - **September 30, 2023 (Six days later)**\n\nI didn't think I'd be back so soon, but it's my mom's world and we all just live in it.\n\nMy mother got 911 called on her for domestic violence on Tuesday. She apparently started throwing wine bottles at her boyfriend who locked himself in the bathroom and called the cops while she destroyed their place in one of her temper tantrums. She wasn't making any sense when the cops got there so they restrained her and took her to a hospital. She's been stuck in the psychiatric ward ever since. My sister was listed as a contact for her and she got the call about mom on Wednesday. The doctors at the hospital spoke to my sister and they think she may be showing signs of alcohol related dementia and some sort of psychotic disorder like bipolar disorder. They currently have her in alcohol detox and from what my sister was told, it's pretty bad. They won't allow her visitors until she's out of detox, not that anyone really has a desire to visit her anymore.\n\nMy sister and I decided enough was enough and we've petitioned a guardianship for her yesterday at the request of a social worker who interviewed my sister, my uncles, my grandparents, and myself. A guardianship means they can hold her while it winds through the system rather than her being released after 72 hours. My grandmother's upset as she thinks all of the issues should be kept in the family and the state shouldn't step in. My uncles and grandfather are on the side of having a guardianship. As far as they're concerned, she's not welcome in the family anymore and they won't allow her to continue to take advantage of anyone in the family anymore. My sister and I say let her be a professional's problem and let them figure out what to do with her. My brothers don't care and have effectively washed their hands of her years ago so their stance is whatever keeps her as far away as humanly possible. We can't deal with her anymore and why should we? With the guardianship petitioned, I'm working on washing my hands of this situation entirely. I'm sure I'll be interviewed about why a guardianship is necessary but other than that, I don't plan to have any further contact with my mom unless she apologizes and makes amends for her behavior, if that's something she's even capable of anymore. I just don't see that happening and any compassion or understanding I had for her in the past is gone. Whatever state her life is in, she brought it on herself. I just want to move on with my life without her in it and be done with her for good.\n\nIt doesn't look like she'll be released from the hospital any time soon so there's no risk of her attending my wedding. I did talk to her boyfriend yesterday after sister and I filed our paperwork and we decided to invite him to lunch. He's decided to break up with her for good and we learned just how bad things were with her. He's a real nice guy who's been caught up in a bad situation and had no clue how bad she could be. I feel really bad for him. I did decide to invite him to my wedding as I can tell he's a lonely dude who's been to hell and back. Not sure he'll show but the offer is there.\n\nThere was a time I'd have allowed an event like this to ruin the run up to the wedding but I've been able to separate my mom's behavior from the wedding. It hasn't put a damper on it. Now that my mom is squared away, I can enjoy myself. I just put the final touches on the catering order and am expecting the last of my supplies. My aunt wants to put the final touches on my wedding attire. If I haven't mentioned, both fiance and I are huge steampunk fans and so we're wearing steampunk attire and encouraging everyone else to dress in steampunk (not required, though). My \"wedding dress\" is actually more of a suit situation but it looks bad ass.\n\nI don't think I'll update again as I want to put all of this behind me and I don't plan to have any contact with my mother going forward. I'm looking forward to a bright future with my husband. My mom can stay in the past and as cold and heartless as it sounds, I'm glad she's not going to be my family's problem anymore.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DISCLAIMER: OOP HAS UPDATED AFTER THE BoRU WAS POSTED**\n\n**SO PER RULES UPDATE IS INCLUDED**\n\n[**Post-wedding update**](https://www.reddit.com/user/throwaway4meeeeeee86/comments/1744oi5/postwedding_update/?share_id=ztHb-zBzD3Mkm6rrDxyOH&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1) - **October 9, 2023 (Nine days later)**\n\nI just signed into this account again with a lot of people begging for updates. I don't have a lot. I guess my entire story is now in the best of Reddit. Thanks, I guess. I never knew dealing with my alcoholic mother was worthy of a best of post. I just wanted to rant and sanity check myself.\n\nOnly news on my mother is she's out of detox and currently in a \"catatonic state\" refusing to speak, eat, or drink water. They may install a feeding tube if she doesn't let up. I think she's trying to be dramatic and get attention, so do my uncles. I could be wrong, but honestly I don't care anymore. We're not sure she has dementia but she definitely has something going on but doing any kind of evaluation while she acts like this is difficult. She also has liver disease, needs dialysis and possibly even a transplant (if she qualifies). The doctors made it very clear if she doesn't quit drinking, she will die within the next 5 years and it may even still be too late. I think I'd feel more sad but I've had to realize that I lost my mother long ago. I did invite my mom's boyfriend but he chose not to come. He's decided to get help for his own alcohol issues, according my sister. I wish him the best.\n\nAs for the wedding, I'm now happily married and on Wednesday I took a pregnancy test that came back positive. We're super excited but haven't told anyone in our family yet. The wedding was fantastic and the day went off without a hitch. We had a blast and are heading out on our honeymoon on Wednesday to Costa Rica. My brothers and stepbrothers very sweetly hazed my husband during the at-home bachelor party and made it clear they're excited to have another brother. My stepmom did all of the mom stuff during the wedding. That was already planned before all of this. No one snuck in alcohol, there weren't any scenes. The worst that happened was my sister crying due to all of the stress she's been under. I do have some sympathy but most of it is self-inflicted though because she enables. But all in all, it was a great day and I was surrounded by those I love most. I know a lot of people asked for pics on my wedding suit. I will see if there's some way I can crop identifying stuff from it and post it here once I get my wedding pictures back. Otherwise, I'll figure out a way to post the outfits themselves.\n\nThat's all I have. I'll try and update after my honeymoon. Now it seems like baby is coming so no promises.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB \u0013 I AM NOT OOP**","subreddit":"BestofRedditorUpdates","comments":226,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/171wru2/aita_for_not_allowing_my_mother_to_bring_her/","_row":"10"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-09","timestamp":1696831722,"title":"10 month old golden retriever died while with Rover sitter","text":"\nMy 10 month old golden recently died while being boarded with a Rover sitter. Rover has been a nightmare to deal with. I am a service member who was in the process of pcsing and thus boarded my dog near my first duty station until we got our house at our new duty station. \n\n I was notified of pup\u0019s death with a less than 60 second phone call from the sitter and was given two hours to pick up his body despite being thousands of miles away. His injuries did not appear to be consistent with the sitter\u0019s 60 second explanation. Neither Rover nor the sitter offered to assist with transporting Zion\u0019s remains to be cremated despite knowing how far away I am. They also aren\u0019t offering to have his ashes mailed to me.\n\nRover has reached out to me numerous times from a recorded line. During my one call with Rover, I requested they pay for a necropsy (animal autopsy) as he was only 10 months old and the sitter\u0019s description of his death seemed suspicious. Rover told me no. Rover eventually said that they will think about it. Rover also tried to guilt trip me to \u001cconsider adopting a dog next time\u001d likely as a jab towards Zion being purebred.\n\nRover also pestered me (through calls and creepy emails) to provide a summary of what happened to Zion as part of their \u001cholistic safety review.\u001d When I asked for a copy of their review I was informed that \u001cdue to privacy concerns\u001d they will not share it. Rover now alleges that the sitter refuses to provide them a summary of how Zion died. Despite this, Rover will not commit to permanently banning this sitter from their platform.\n\nIf Rover cares about the safety of dogs on their platform, they need to commit to transparency with all users- by making any safety reviews public and funding necropsies for pets that die under unclear circumstances while in there care.\n\nUPDATE: I originally did not include Zion\u0019s cause of death as I did not want to upset people. However quite a few people are asking. The sitter claimed that he put Zion in a chainlink enclosure while they were doing yard work. During that time Zion (allegedly) jumped up and got his collar caught on a piece of decorative metal work on the gate. The sitter claimed that Zion essentially hung himself and was already deceased when sitter finished the yard work. As I was in another state, I had to scramble to get someone to pick him up. My ex-husband blessedly dropped what he was doing to pick up Zion\u0019s body.\n\nMy ex drove Zion\u0019s body around for a few hours while we waited for a response from Rover. my ex eventually became concerned about having the body in his car when it was over 105 degrees outside. He thus took zion to be cremated without a necropsy. The cremation people noted zion had no broken neck.\n\nI will also note that the collar zion wore when he died was put on and came from the sitter. I had zion in a vest but the sitter insisted he wear a gps collar the sitter had. I don\u0019t think zion could have strangled or hung himself if he had his vest on instead of the collar.","subreddit":"RoverPetSitting","comments":346,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/RoverPetSitting/comments/173ko83/10_month_old_golden_retriever_died_while_with/","_row":"11"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-17","timestamp":1697585569,"title":"This Rental literally saying you can't be in the house on weekend.","text":"","subreddit":"australia","comments":599,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/17ac3zp/this_rental_literally_saying_you_cant_be_in_the/","_row":"12"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-06","timestamp":1696601344,"title":"Spot the Carbrain challenge (impossible)","text":"Top comment under this IG post.

Things have been up and down for us both so although it\u0019s not the most ideal living arrangement it\u0019s made things slightly easier during this rough patch. However with situations like this it\u0019s becoming a problem. I\u0019ve never been so serious and so in love with someone so I believe sometimes it definitively clouds my judgement on situations but, this time I think I really messed up unintentionally. \n\nLast night he messaged from work to say he wanted to come home early as he wasn\u0019t feeling too good, (he works nights). I agreed to stay up until he was ready to come home so I could order him a uber cause public transport is not 24hrs here and we don\u0019t drive. Originally he said he\u0019d be done by 2am so I waited up, he then didn\u0019t communicate with me until 3am and at that point I was shattered. I didn\u0019t complain though, I just ordered him the cab and waited for him to be in it so I knew i\u0019d done what I needed to help&\nThis is where it goes tits up. Sidebar before I continue, EVERYTIME he leaves for work my first question is \u001cdo you have your key?\u001d His response was \u001cyes it\u0019s in my pocket\u001d. So as far as I was concerned i\u0019d done my job for the night I could finally rest, phone back on silent and he\u0019d be home soon for cuddles.\nBut no, he didn\u0019t have his key and of course i was fast asleep and didn\u0019t hear my phone to the point he rang it so many times it died! \nHe didn\u0019t ring the bell cause he didn\u0019t want it to wake up my mom or son(5) but 2bh I would have rather he did. So he ended up waiting outside for over an hour until I eventually woke up realised he wasn\u0019t in bed and my phone was dead. I could literally feel the panic rush throughout h my body and I shot up to rush to the door and saw him standing there, I was met by some f\u0019s and offs\u0019 and I knew it wasn\u0019t good.\n\nHe is so so so so so angry at me and I completely understand why but then my argument is, I ask him about his key to avoid this very situation from happening because I know myself and I can drop like a fly when i\u0019m tired.\nAnyway I\u0019m not asking who\u0019s in the wrong because nothing was done intentionally or maliciously it\u0019s just a shitty situation. \nI just have no idea how to make things right, I know we\u0019ll probably get through it but then I also can see that this is bigger than any other time we\u0019ve \u001cargued\u001d and I genuinely do feel so horrible about it.

Weaponized incompetence, leaving women to bear the brunt of child rearing and the mental load, sexual harassment and violence, laws limiting our access to reproductive care/abortions, belittling or disregarding our experiences, entire religions focused on subjugating women, women's complaints being ignored in healthcare settings, the list goes on. \n\nI find myself regularly expecting or thinking the worst of men. Maybe it's the guy at the gas station who I feel is being creepy but he's just getting gas, or watching a young family at the grocery store and mom is corralling the kids while dad blissfully is along for the ride, noticing at large family functions its the women who eat last and get up first to clean up, interpreting interactions with my male industry peers as disrespectful. \n\nEven when I am watching a show/movie or reading a book, I spot negative behavior from the male characters and it sours it for me. For awhile if news came out about an artist or actor about them being general shitbags, I have an aversion to any media they put out, etc. \n\nIt's frustrating for me bc I am not a hateful person at all and I know a lot of wonderful men in my life. My husband is amazing and very much equally shares the mental load/kids/work, has never treated me as anything different than a whole person first, cried with me when RvW was overturned. My BIL is the same way with my sister, my dad and stepdad both have had always been my supporters and never made my sister or me feel like we couldn't do something because we're girls. I have friends with equally as adjusted and contributing partners and my husband and BIL. \n\nI have no lack of examples of loving, kind men around me but I still have this constant and nagging feeling that \"men suck\" and I can't help but notice the most minute details of patriarchy and sexism affecting things around me. \n\nI logically understand that this is a long standing societal and cultural issue and that any one individual is a sum of their experiences, and large changes are difficult to come about and maintain but that just feels like a cop out excuse to keep the staus quo and just ignore the very real and legitimate suffering women face daily. \n\nI've considered a media diet, but that just feels like cognitive dissonance now that the veil has been pulled back for me. Idk, maybe I just needed to scream into the void or hear other people's feelings on the subject.\n\n\nEdit: this is getting way more attention than I expected it to, and I'm excited that there's genuine discussion going on. I just wanted to clarify that I'm not condoning hating men \"bc they're men\" and I understand that the internet and reddit in particular can become an echo chamber. I do plan to take a step back from my use of reddit and sm bc it's clearly affecting me. \n\nI also wanted to clarify that while I think reddit/sm is exacerbating these feelings I'm having, the feelings didn't sprout from only exposure to things online and that my having some wonderful men in my life is not mutually exclusive to having negative experiences with men irl. \n\nI've had a doctor tell me I'm less intelligent and capable bc I'm a woman while in grad school. \nI've had male patients tell me I should stay home insread of work. \nI've been SA'd, know of endless other women who've had similar experiences. \nI've had men assume I'm flirting with them, hang around the bar until I got off work, and try to follow me to my car when I was just taking their drink order. \nI've been groped on public transport. \nI've had to take a friend to the hospital and be there for her as she gives a statement to the police bc her husband choked her to unconsciousness. \nI've watched parts of my extended family defend my child molester uncle to not rock the boat. \nI've been cornered by men while taking a walk on the beach, and only came out safe bc I lied through my teeth that my husband was meeting me.\nI had a predatory and disgusting youth pastor throughout middle school that took advantage of one of my friends. \n\nThese are just examples that I am recalling quickly, but if I sat here long enough, I could think of A LOT more. And it's this life long and continuous exposure in my lived experiences where these feelings of frustration, disillusionment, and helplessness started.\n\n\n\n\nTldr: I don't want to automatically dislike or think the worst of men, but don't know how to not feel that way in face of the constant exposure to adversities women face daily.","subreddit":"TwoXChromosomes","comments":998,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/16tj3mf/does_any_one_else_worry_about_their_internal/","_row":"17"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-07","timestamp":1696671810,"title":"My (F27) boyfriend (M29) has a problem with me visiting my ex-boyfriend (M28) and won't admit it.","text":"**I am NOT OP.

My boyfriend claims he's fine with it, but his behavior suggests otherwise. Overall, our communication is good, but I'm bothered by his sudden change regarding this situation.\n\nMy ex and I were together for four years, but we amicably separated six years ago as we grew apart, typical of young love. Since I spent two of those four years living at his parents' house, I grew close to his family and friends, some of whom I still stay in daily contact with, including my ex (mainly on Snapchat, but we don't chat much \u0013 it's mostly for sharing updates or keeping streaks).\n\nThat's why I visit the town 100km away every year for the annual \"town festival,\" to see old faces, share stories, and have fun. The festival lasts from Friday evening to Sunday afternoon, and I often help with serving, setting up, and cleaning.\n\nI've been dating my current boyfriend for four months, locally. It's a relatively new relationship, but I've learned from past relationships the importance of open communication, which has worked well for us. I've never hidden the fact that I'm still friends with my ex, nor that nothing has happened between us since the breakup.\n\nA few days ago, we discussed our weekend plans for the next few weeks, and I mentioned my upcoming visit to my ex's home in two weeks. He didn't take it well, even though he had never had an issue with our friendship before. He finds it \"weird\" and \"odd\" that I'm visiting my ex while being in a new relationship, and I agree with him. I'm aware that it's not the norm.\n\nI've never given him a reason not to trust me. I've never cheated in past relationships, and having experienced being cheated on myself, I know how painful it is, and I'd never do that. He says he trusts me, or rather, he says he \"has to trust me\" because he has no other choice. He doesn't forbid me from visiting my ex, but his tone and behavior indicate that it bothers him. When I asked him how he feels about it, he simply said, \"I can't change it, so it doesn't matter what I think.\"\n\nI understand that communication is a learning curve, and this is his first longer-term relationship, so I'm willing to be patient as we both navigate this. However, it's been five days since we first talked about it, and there's no improvement in sight. I'll definitely still visit my ex because my main goal is to see people I'm not in touch with on social media. But I don't know how long I can tolerate my boyfriend's lack of communication. It's just a tiny part of our relationship. Most of the time, he communicates openly. It's just in this case, he's not, and it's bothering me immensely.\n\nEdit: Thank you very much in advance for all the comments. Unfortunately, I have a very busy weekend ahead, so I won't be able to respond to everyone, but I will read every comment. Just from quickly skimming through, I've already noticed some things that will definitely give me food for thought.\n\nEdit 2: Just a few things I've read a few times; I offered my boyfriend to come along. My ex's parents took me in like their own child, and I'm sure they would be excited to meet my boyfriend, their \"foundling.\" However, my boyfriend declined without giving a reason. He also didn't want to meet my ex beforehand, claiming it would be \"weird.\"\n\nEdit 3: My \"main issue\" is that I'd like to talk about the whole situation, possibly find a compromise, and ease both his and my conscience. However, it's challenging when he doesn't want to discuss it with me. That would be fine; we don't have to talk about everything. But he denies that there's anything to discuss, yet at the same time, he makes passive-aggressive comments that suggest he's not okay with it.\n\nEdit 4: I wouldn't have a problem if he visited an ex. I generally trust him until he gives me a reason not to. But apparently, that might be naive of me?\n\nEdit 5: I won't be staying in my ex's house; I'll be staying with his neighbor, with whom I'm in daily contact.\n\nEdit 6: I can't exactly pinpoint my question for you. I think I just wanted to get this off my chest, sort out my thoughts.\n\n---\n\n#A few comments\n\n&gt; You would do that to me exactly twice: the first and the last time. Unbelievable behavior.\n\n&gt; Who does something like that =\u0005 I would never in my life let my girlfriend go to her ex, let alone stay overnight. Even maintaining contact with the parents and, even worse, the ex, I can't comprehend. I couldn't do it in my life, and I think it's very rare for another guy not to care if his girlfriend talks to her ex. Usually, it's a big no-go. I don't know anyone who would be cool with it.\n\n&gt; I can understand that you don't want to simply give up on your acquaintances/friends from the past. However, please be aware that this is a tough pill for your boyfriend to swallow. He's your ex, and I assume you'll be staying there as well? That would be a problem for many. Your boyfriend seems to be doing his best to cope with the situation and isn't forbidding anything, yet you're still dissatisfied? He's showing you that it hurts him, and you (in my opinion) are just finding faults in him (communication) instead of seeing what you're currently expecting/demanding from him. I don't want to attack you, but I want to give you some food for thought: your views on meetings with ex-partners and perfect communication may not necessarily align with his. Give him some time to process this, instead of counting the days when, in your opinion, he's not \"functioning ideally\n\n---\n\n#Update\n\n[**UPDATE: My (F27) boyfriend (M29) has a problem with me visiting my ex-boyfriend (M28) and won't admit it.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/beziehungen/comments/16shlu6/)\n\nTuesday, September 26 2023 (a month later)\n\n*removed TLDR of first post*\n\nFirst of all, a massive thank you to everyone who commented. As I mentioned, I didn't have time to respond to everyone over the weekend, but I read everything multiple times. You tore me apart in the comments, but that's exactly what I needed \u0013 a wake-up call. I realized that I definitely mishandled the whole situation by presenting my boyfriend with a fait accompli. That was pretty selfish of me, probably because I haven't been in a serious relationship for six years and had gotten used to a lifestyle where I only had to consider myself for decisions. But that's, of course, no excuse or justification for my actions, so on to the actual update.\n\nAfter the weekend, I initiated another conversation with my boyfriend. First and foremost, I apologized and basically explained to him what I wrote above. That my freedom over the past few years had apparently made me selfish and uncompromising, and that I definitely need to work on myself and how I communicate things.\n\nI then tried to explain to him in more detail why visiting my ex was so important to me. His family took me in when my parents kicked me out back then. They loved me as if I were their own child, just when I needed it most. Not just once did they pull me out of a depressive (in one case, even suicidal) pit, and I will be forever grateful for that. I'm still in regular contact with my ex's friends and meet up with someone from the group about every two months. I tried to make him understand that I'm not specifically going to see my ex but everyone who lives in that village. The annual town festival is THE weekend of the year when everyone comes together there. I told him how sorry I was but that the visit had been arranged for almost 10 months, and they were also counting on my help with the festival, and I would feel guilty. I had been looking forward to the festival for so long that not being able to go would break my heart a little. But despite all of this, none of these things were the end of the world, and they could somehow be straightened out. If he really wanted me to, I could cancel it.\n\nHis reaction surprised me. He communicated that, thanks to the detailed explanation, he now understood and was happy for me to see those people again. He said that what had originally bothered him was how I had communicated it. He told me to go and have fun. However, he couldn't come along due to other commitments. The following two weeks were quite uneventful. Whenever the visit was mentioned, he genuinely seemed happy for me.\n\nFast forward to the Friday I was supposed to leave. I came home from work at noon, packed the last of my things, and was ready to drive off. Except I couldn't find my car keys. I was sure they were on the hook that morning, but they weren't there. I searched the entire house. Nada, nothing. I then messaged my boyfriend, who was still at work, asking if he had seen them. After half an hour, he replied that he didn't know, but he could check his pockets to see if they were there. I thanked him and waited. Another half-hour passed, and he messaged that they were indeed in his pocket but that I didn't need to come to get them (it would take 30 minutes each way by public transport) because he'd be home in an hour anyway.\n\nI thought, alright, I'll wait for that hour and then leave. That way, I'll see him again before I go. After an hour and a half of waiting, I called him. He was still out with a colleague having a drink. At that moment, I had already given up on leaving that day without being overly tired. I told him not to rush, that I'd wait. So, I laid down on the couch and watched some TV series. Shortly before 11 at night, my boyfriend came home slightly tipsy and acted like everything was normal. I asked him if he could give me the car key so that I could leave early in the morning. After a few minutes of hesitation, he said that he had left it at work.\n\nUp until that point, I had remained calm because mistakes can happen. But then, I got angry. I asked if he was serious. Yes, he said, he was sorry, but there was nothing he could do now. The office was closed until Monday. But we could have a nice weekend at home. At that moment, I still didn't want to believe that he had orchestrated all of this, although the thought had briefly crossed my mind. I also couldn't talk about it anymore and started crying. To calm myself down, I decided to take my luggage and stay with a friend. In response, he left the room without saying a word and returned a minute later with the car key, which he had suddenly \"found\" and asked me to stay until the next morning.\n\nAfter another 15 minutes of crying, I drove to my friend's place anyway, and the next morning, I went to my ex-boyfriend's. Because I was there to help with the festival, I didn't have time to think about the situation or talk to him. But during the car ride home, I spent a long time trying to find a logical explanation for his behavior. I failed miserably. It's not even his car. He hardly ever drives my car, and when he does, he usually asks beforehand. So, I was pretty sure that all of this was planned. When I got home, he acted as if everything was okay, but he still seemed passive-aggressive. After unpacking, I confronted him during dinner about whether the whole thing was really an \"accident.\"\n\nAfter repeatedly asking him because things seemed illogical to me (e.g., why he should take my key to work at all), he suddenly got very angry. He said he never said or meant it that way. Was I too stupid to understand his words? Both he and I exchanged insults and shouted at each other. Then a plate flew in my direction, and I left and spent the rest of the day with friends. I knew the relationship was over, but he may not have realized it yet. The next day, while he was at work, two friends and I packed all of his things, and then we waited for him to come home. He probably thought he could talk his way out of it again, but I told him it was over. He didn't want to accept it until he saw his packed things. He became loud and aggressive again, but after a ten-minute tirade, he finally returned my house key (threw it on the ground and spat on it) with the words \"You damn slut, you'll regret this when you die alone! But at least you can screw your ex without a guilty conscience. That was surely your plan, that's what you wanted, right?\" and then he left. Since then, I've blocked him everywhere and haven't seen him, and I hope it stays that way.\n\nI used to think that stories like these, when you read them on Reddit, are often exaggerated or even made up. And now something this crazy happened to me. I have no idea where it came from or how deep these aggressions were lurking inside him. To be honest, I'm still shocked by what came out of him. I've never been so afraid of another person and actually don't want to deal with the incident anymore, which is why the ending is probably quite short and lacking detail compared to the rest of the story.\n\nTLDR:\n\nI sincerely apologized and promised to work on myself. My boyfriend told me he forgave me and it was okay for me to visit my ex, but on the day I was supposed to leave, he hid my car keys to stop me. I ended up going anyway, and when I returned home, he exploded because I went. He threw a plate at me. Now he's also my ex-boyfriend (but I definitely won't be visiting him).\n\n---\n\n#A few comments\n\n&gt; You made the right decision to break up with him. Such manipulative behavior destroys trust, and you can't have a relationship with someone who plays such games. I'm sorry it escalated this way. Aggressive behavior is also unacceptable. Obviously, it made him very insecure that you went to see your ex. I think almost anyone would have felt strange about it. I would have asked him if he wanted to come along instead of excluding him. Before the relationship failed, your communication failed. However, that does not justify his behavior under any circumstances.\n\n&gt; The comments section is wild. Many seem unable to distinguish between \"allowing/prohibiting\" and \"you can do XY, but I have the following opinion and will probably draw those consequences.\" The end result may be the same, but the former implies a power imbalance, while the latter does not. Allowing or prohibiting things is done with children or people over whom one thinks they have control. The other option is a relationship on an equal footing, where each person can decide for themselves about possible consequences. So, if someone wants to visit their ex, you can say, \"You are welcome to do that; however, I don't like it for these and those reasons, and I will reconsider our relationship.\" Then both sides know where they stand on this matter and can make a decision with appropriate consequences. For some, this might be a deal-breaker, for others not. Hiding car keys, manipulating, and throwing dishes are absolutely unacceptable. It's good that OP decided to end the relationship.\n\n---\n\n**Reminder - I am not the original poster and the posts and comments were originally in German**\n\n*Marked as concluded as they broke up.*","subreddit":"BestofRedditorUpdates","comments":666,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1722f9j/my_f27_boyfriend_m29_has_a_problem_with_me/","_row":"18"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-25","timestamp":1695637938,"title":"romantic vandal","text":"Seriously though, I feel bad for the person who will have to clean that. @ Flinders st station.","subreddit":"melbourne","comments":45,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/16rocwy/romantic_vandal/","_row":"19"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-13","timestamp":1697172517,"title":"I (30M) hit my father (51M) for a past mistake.","text":"Disposable account\n\n\r  \nI am from Peru, from a provincial city, when I was 18 years old my cousin, who is the same age as mine, accused me of having raped her, she and I were very close since we were children since we used to spend time together, due to family problems she began to have depression.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt wasn't like before, now all she did was scream, get angry or even blame me because I didn't have the same problems as her, the truth is I was trying to help her, but my own mental health was beginning to deteriorate so I decided little by little to move away. Months passed and I had no contact with her until one day my father came to my house and called me, I went out to meet him and he received me with a slap in the face, it should be noted that my father had never hit me before, who did that was my mother and only for specific reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I ask him about the reason behind the hit, he slapped me again and told me to get out of the house, that his brother (my cousin's father) had told him that my cousin said that I raped her and that's why she was so depressed, apparently her dad realized that she was cutting herself and to get out of it she just blamed me for everything, my cousin didn't press charges (Obviously because there is no proof) but still my dad told me that my uncle wanted to beat me up, my dad was disappointed in me, he hit me again, called me an abuser, insulted me and told me to get out of his house, my mom was always a submissive person with him so she didn't say anything to him, I simply with my lip bleeding grabbed my most valuable things and left, thank God I had my savings on my card from what I had worked for and I was able to go to the capital by public transportation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Once in the capital I managed to rent a small room, I had a bad time for the next few years, I had a couple or two for a few years and jumping from job to job to survive. When I was 20 years old, my partner at that time told me that I could work at the KFC where she worked as a delivery order receptionist. The part-time job paid well and with the bonuses you could even earn double or triple my salary, so I worked there doing the best I could while studying a technical degree in administration.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYears passed and I ended up becoming a supervisor and then manager of that store thanks to my technical degree in business administration. At the age of 25 I became a partner with a former university classmate with whom I still had contact (She is a lawyer) and the age of 27 we got married, it was a small wedding because both she and I are modest with expenses and because I had no family to invite, we currently have a one-year-old son whom I love with all my soul.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was after this that everything went to hell, today in the middle of the afternoon there was a knock at my door, it was my parents, it had been more than a decade since I had seen them, I was frozen but not with fear, but with anger, my dad asked me if he could come in, I told him no, so we talked in a nearby park, in short, they told me that my cousin had committed suicide and that in her letter she confessed the whole truth, that the person who actually abused her was her mother's brother and that everything was orchestrated by him to be able to cover up and other things, the truth is I was very indifferent, for me whoever accuses of those crimes deserves to suffer them in flesh, so I didn't feel sorry for her, I told them kindly (and resisting my urge to yell at them) to go away and never contact me again, that they were dead to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I stood up from the bench to go home my dad grabbed me by the shoulder, he told me that we have to keep talking, I told him no, he insisted, I told him no, he insisted again, so I turned around and instinctively gave him a hit, I don't know when my dad became so weak, any latino knows that country men are quite strong, but one hit was enough to break his nose, he stood stunned looking at me with his eyes open and his nose bleeding and my Mom was covering her mouth, for some reason that I don't explain, my next reaction was to throw myself at him, it wasn't difficult to knock him to the ground and I continued hitting him, when he started to cover his face I started hitting his head or forehead, I'll not lie, it felt liberating, I felt like I was crying while I hit him and I continued until my right hand was hurting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother stood still, for some reason she didn't do anything, she just stood there watching and crying, by that time it was already night and in our area it was difficult to find people on the street, even less so considering that today there is a soccer game, my Mom helped my dad and took a taxi, she didn't say anything to me, she didn't scream, she just cried and as soon as she grabbed my dad she ran away, I'm not lying, if she had tried to intervene maybe she would have gotten the same treatment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few hours later my mother writes to me on my cell phone, apparently they contacted a friend from university (I still have my social networks active) who told them where I lived, saying that my father needs a septum reconstruction because it was perforated and dental reconstruction For having 4 broken teeth, everything was going to cost the equivalent of 4k USD, which is a lor of money here, not a fortune but it\u0019s a lot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have already been clear with her, I am not going to put in a single cent, for my sake she and my dad could end up just like my cousin, I don't care, she has been calling me, asking for forgiveness for everything, that she wants to come back into my life , that she was afraid and that she should have protected me or at least believed me, according to her my dad felt the same and according to him he deserves every hit I gave him, I guess we agree on that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told my wife everything, she already knew what happened in the past with my parents, she just told me that she understood, that, according to what I told her, my father died when he kicked me out of his house, so who did I hit was just a stranger with his face, I found her comparison funny and I agreed with her, she told me that if they tried legal measures we would simply say that it was in self-defense, a law was recently passed in which lethal force can even be used when It's about self-defense, so if something happens to him we can rely on that, right now I'm glad I have a lawyer wife, I can't help but feel more liberated after this, my parents aren't poor so I know they'll get the money for the operation, I hope they just aren't idiots enough to come back to my house, this is my home now and if I have to beat them both to get the hell out of my life, I will, at the end of the day, they are the ones who started all this, I was just defending myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still feel a little euphoric and happy, the truth is, I am a little happy that they are suffering, they deserve it, I am happy with my life and my family, and I would protect them at any cost, that includes my parents. I needed to get this off my chest somehow so I'm writing this to release it, somehow telling it all has made me feel better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;","subreddit":"stories","comments":1968,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/176qpx3/i_30m_hit_my_father_51m_for_a_past_mistake/","_row":"20"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-09","timestamp":1696810836,"title":"How is this allowed?","text":"2hr 18 on car\n\n1day 5hr on public transportation\n\n156 miles.","subreddit":"fuckcars","comments":107,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/173ebmr/how_is_this_allowed/","_row":"21"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-12","timestamp":1697091582,"title":"Found these on one of my travels.

One, I was in public transport, and this random man walked around saying \"Jesus Christ is my Lord and Saviour!\" and try to engage with people. I simply ignored him as he went on, and then he went to me. He tried to talk with me, and when he realised I refused to engage he became persistent and proceeded to touch my arm. I pushed him away and loudly stated that he is overstepping boundaries, to which he became aggressive (I'm glad my destination was the next stop). The second one happened today, while I was at Uni, when the Chancellor declared that God shall guide all of the students in the new academic year, and a priest proceeded to walk into every seminar room and bless it. I was borderline coerced by the tutor into kissing the cross the priest had presented like my fellow peers, to which I refused. \n\nI have no way to file complaints for these situations, because harassment over having a different religion (or none) is not taken seriously as a legal offence, and it can go as bad as facing ridiculisation from the authorities because of it.

In May of 1960, Seppo now 18, began dating a girl, 15-year-old Anja Tuulikki Mäki. Around the same time, Nils began dating another 15-year-old named Maila Irmeli Björklund.\n\nTwo weeks after Nils's birthday, [the four](https://imgur.com/jxggl6L) decided to go camping near Lake Bodom outside of Espoo located in Finland's Uusimaa Region. Maila was excited for the upcoming holidays and her first summer without having to care for her younger brothers. Although Seppo and Nils's parents saw them as reliable and trusted them, Maila and Anja's parents were reluctant to let them go camping alone as they saw it was unsafe and only agreed after relentless begging.\n\nThe campsite was a 30-minute drive from their home in Helsinki. They arrived on June 4, 1960, and Seppo got to work borrowing a canvas tent, brought fishing gear, a few knives, pliers, two bottles of strong liquor and a dozen light beers from home. Nils bought bread, sausages and snacks. In the afternoon the Seppo and Nils borrowed two motorcycles which they used to drive them and Anja and Maila to the campsite. The four set up on the south shore of the lake where they found a satisfactory camping spot on a small peninsula. Only a few steps away from the beach. Their camping spot was noted for being in a safe and private location.\n\nSeppo and Nils not long after, dropped off their backpacks and reboarded their motorcycles and drove back to the campsite canteen one kilometer away from their campsite. They purchased a few packs of chewing gum and bottles of soda to mix with wine. By the time they returned to the campsite, it was already 7:15 p.m. and thus not many people were outside anymore. The last thing known about what they were doing was how they set up their single tent which could barely fit all four people leaving it quite crowded.\n\nEarly the next morning on June 5, two young people were going for a stroll alongside the south shore of Lake Bodom. It was nearly 6:00 a.m. when they heard the sound of someone moving and found higher ground to try and locate the source of the sound. There, the two found two motorcycles leaning against a birch tree. They also found a partially collapsed tent. On the tent was a man lying on the tent. His face could not be clearly seen and could only note that he was wearing dark trousers. Later, they saw another man walking away from the tent and into the woods. The two again, couldn't make out his face and only saw that he was wearing a light-coloured shirt. The man entered the woods and later disappeared. The two wanted to get a closer look at the motorcycles but left so as to not disturb their fellow campers.\n\nAround the same time a 14-year-old boy named Olavi Kivilahti, was sitting by the rocks near the lake waiting for those he was fishing with to return. While waiting he noticed a young man about 20 years old of average height, with brown hair combed back, wearing a light-coloured shirt and dark trousers walking out of the forest. He then walked southward and disappeared from his view.\n\nBy 10:00 a.m. more and more campers were waking up leading to the tent being noticed by many more. A group of teenagers swimming in the lake nearby to the campsite saw the tent collapsed with a man lying on top of it. They assumed there was a fight going on between campers and decided they didn't want to get involved. At 11:15 a.m. a passerby saw the same man lying on the tent and he would be the one to finally take action. He ran towards a nearby construction site to use a public phone to call the police.\n\nThe local police accompanied by detectives arrived. The man lying on top of the tent was Nils. Nils had been heavily beaten as his face was swollen including his eyes swollen shut. Nils also suffered several fractures to the left side of his jaw, cheekbone and temple. Other injuries consisted of stab wounds to his left forearm and right face, and a stab wound to his cheek that completely cut through the muscle exposing his teeth.\n\n[The police looked inside the tent](https://imgur.com/7m58Ypv) and [found the other three campers](https://imgur.com/LYq2T26). Seppo was lying on the edge of the tent near the entrance with his hands placed on his chest. He had been struck several times on the chin and face with a blunt object with several fractures to his skull. Furthermore, he had been stabbed multiple times through the tent canvas with two fatal wounds to his neck and chest. Anja was found curled up, face down with her shirt pulled up over her head. She had suffered several blunt force wounds to her head resulting in skull fractures. Lastly, Maila was lying near the tent of the curtain her left leg was parallel to Anja's back, and her right leg was bent on Anja's head. Maila's shirt was pulled up to her shoulders and her jeans pulled down toward her knees. She had suffered three blunt force wounds to her head resulting in fractures to her skull and jaw causing severe brain swelling and intracranial bleeding. Lastly, she had suffered 15 stab wounds to her neck and shoulders. Nils was miraculously still alive and rushed to hospital.\n\nThe police believed that the killer first cut the drawstring and left the canvas of the tent alone so he could easily see the heads of the campers to strike with them being trapped and unable to escape under the tent and that they wouldn't be able to see their attacker. The police collected all of their items from the crime scene consisting of clothes, bags, cigarettes, cosmetics and a lyrics book belonging to Anja. Police also found four knives but none of them were the murder weapons. Two of their bottles of alcohol were left behind with one containing an unknown fingerprint not belonging to any of the four.\n\nSeveral other items, however, were missing consisting of their wallets and ID cards, a knife, Seppo's leather jacket, two male watches, shoes and the keys to the motorcycles. Over the next few days, [police alongside several volunteers](https://imgur.com/vD4k9jR)  and even soldiers conducted various searches of the campground. The police used metal detectors and dogs, [as well as searching the lake](https://imgur.com/k9Noo9t) and using divers to go to the bottom of Lake Bodom with every single item recovered from the bottom of the lake being recovered. On the side of the road 500 meters away from the crime scene, the police found [a pair of worn-out brown leather shoes](https://imgur.com/Up4fwA5) under a stone with several blood stains on them and another pair of shoes in the bushes across from the road. The first pair of shoes belonged to Nils while the other pair were Seppo's.\n\nDue to the violent nature of the crime, it was made the police's main priority. The police appealed to the public for information and asked them to come forward if they had any information on the killer. After this appeal, the police had to deal with dozens of false leads including people being reported to police for no other reason aside from being out late. None of those reported to police had any evidence indicating guilt and every single suspect was released.\n\nThe police's investigation reached a dead end for the time being as they had no suspects. While the police were chasing leads the locals had their own suspect, a 51-year-old man named [Karl Valdemar Gyllström](https://imgur.com/WTrW6XB). Karl owned a Truck Stop and Kiosk nearby to the canteen and campsite so many campers would often visit his establishment to purchase various items. Karl was known for his violent temper which seemed to come and go. Karl would hide razor blades inside the apples growing on trees near his property to stop and punish the Children picking them and was known as a heavy drinker who despised campers at the lake.\n\nKarl was also known for attacking others. A local resident saw Karl illegally hunting on his land and when he asked Karl to leave he raised his shotgun and shot the man. While the wounds were not fatal the man had to go to the hospital to have shrapnel surgically removed. Karl also held an obsession with the right of way on the road. One time a truck was driving near his business which led to Karl shattering the glass and nearly causing an accident. Karl defended his actions to the police by saying he was trying to scare him off for driving too fast and honking his horn too loudly. Karl always kept a hunting knife and steal pipe on his person at all times and would wooden strips with nails sticking out on the roads to puncture the tires of passing cars and would trespass onto the campsite to cut and vandalize unoccupied tents.\n\nOn June 4, Nils and Seppo had visited his truckstop truck stop and purchased some items before leaving. Karl wasn't working at the time so they conducted their transaction with his wife. After making their purchase they drove past Karl's house on their way to the campsite and Karl's wife admitted to her husband that there were four camping nearby. The morning after Karl was informed of the murders by a local and he reacted to this news very nonchalantly. Karl had just installed a well on his property which only made locals more suspicious, suspecting that Karl disposed of their belongings and the murder weapon at the bottom of the well. Their Nils and Seppo's shoes were also found on the road leading to his truck stop and home.\n\nKarl and his wife were questioned by police. Both Karl and his wife said they were sleeping the night of the murder with Karl staying in the living room and his wife sleeping upstairs with the couple's children. His wife did admit that the door was open but she didn't hear Karl leave. The police searched Karl's home but left after finding nothing of note. This search left the locals very dissatisfied since they viewed it as lacklustre and were especially disappointed with how they ignored the well and didn't search it.\n\nOn June 9, [Nils woke up in the hospital](https://imgur.com/Cy9X9JK) but in severe pain and didn't know where he was. The police wanted to question him but Nils could barely speak often just moaning in pain and whenever he did speak he said that he didn't remember what happened. The police waited again until June 23 when he was discharged from the hospital and left through a backdoor to the police station to give a statement to the police.\n\nAccording to Nils, on June 4 he and Seppo set up their tent at 7:30 p.m. and hung up and spent time until 9:30 p.m. when they finally went to sleep. A few hours later, Nils woke up to the sound of Seppo outside the tent looking for fishing gear. Nils decided to accompany him and later wanted to go for a late swim anyway with Nils estimating that this was at 3:00 a.m. This testimony was considered accurate as Anja had written in her Lyric book \"Seppo and Nils were drunk\"; \"got up at two o'clock in the middle of the night\"; \"Seppo was fishing\" When the police pressed him for what happened next he said that his next memory was waking up in the hospital. The police brought him back to the crime scene in hopes that it could trigger some repressed memories but Nils still couldn't tell them what happened afterwards.\n\nThe police now saw only one option left. They went to the University of Helsinki and requested that a professor specializing in psychiatry put him under hypnosis to dredge up Nils's memories, something this profession had success with with other patients. From July 2-July 5 Nils, was put under hypnosis three times with each session lasting one hour. Nils finally described how he and the others were attacked by a man with a knife and blunt object assumed to be a steel pipe.\n\nWhen asked if he could describe this man he said he could. Based on his description the police ruled that the man was 20\u001330 years old, 173\u0013174 cm tall; had an ordinary body type, round face; long blond hair combed back; normal non-protruding ears. A high forehead: high forehead with uneven horizontal wrinkles, Thick lips, a strong jaw; slightly protruding cheekbones; short neck; white teeth,  thick and large fingers, pimples on the forehead and cheeks and lastly he was wearing, a thick fabric checkered dark blouse with small black buttons. Based on this description [a composite sketch was made and released to the media](https://imgur.com/7BYnRA3). Police received 50 tips based on this sketch and arrested 9 suspects with one suspect being of particular interest.\n\nOn June 6, 36-year-old German National [Hans Assmann](https://imgur.com/X6foYkG) arrived at The Helsinki Surgical Hospital by ambulance with red stains on his hands and overalls. His wife accompanied him to the hospital and said that Hans passed out after experiencing a bout of stomach pain. During their routine tests, a doctor poked Hans's side and in reaction, he let out a little chuckle which alerted hospital staff to the fact that he was likely unconscious. After he was caught in this lie Hans showed no remorse and threatened hospital staff, demanding immediate treatment. This prompted an intern and several other hospital workers to keep a close eye on Hans.\n\nDuring his stay in the hospital, a woman who wasn't his wife visited him at the hospital and they would whisper to each other although nobody knew what they were talking about. Hans would spend hours upon hours washing his hands to try and erase the red stains on his hands. When talking to hospital staff he told police he was a guard at Auschwitz but became disillusioned with Nazism after falling in love with a Jewish girl. He was reassigned and ended up being captured by the Red Army in 1943.  After two years in a POW camp, he fully defected and joined the KGB. He was discharged from the hospital after a few days but continued to return for further treatment and to make the staff more uncomfortable. He once showed a surgeon an article from a German magazine about a cold case and joked that both he and the surgeon were good with a knife but that unlike the surgeon he didn't save anyone with a knife.\n\nBy July the hospital staff grew more and more suspicious of Hans and later suspected him of being responsible for the Lake Bodom Murders. After seeing the sketch in the newspaper they only became more suspicious. They called the police and even collected Hans's bloody clothing to hand off to the police. Hans was, however, never actually arrested and his clothing wasn't tested. According to police, Hans had an airtight alibi but the police never released it to the public.\n\nOther suspects that came to the police's attention were a man named Pauli Luoma. Pauli was a bicycle thief who was seen in the area wearing a backpack that seemed similar to the one stolen from the campers and wearing what appeared to be a bloodied shirt. This man was quickly identified as Pauli but he had an airtight alibi and was seen by numerous witnesses at Otaniemi during the time of the murder.\n\nAnother was 15-year-old Pentti Soininen. Despite his young age, Pentti had committed several violent crimes. In 1969, at 24 years old he was arrested and confessed to many crimes and told police that he was at Lake Bodom during the time of the murder after running away from school. Since he couldn't tell the police any details that wouldn't be gleaned from reading newspapers, no evidence linking him to the crime and Pentti was known for lying to try and build up a reputation the police gave little weight to his confession. Pentti hanged himself at a railway station during a prisoner transport.\n\nThe last suspect we know the least about and the police seem to consider them POIs as opposed to real suspects. Two young men were seen fishing at the lake the night of the murder and would've witnessed the crime and possibly have valuable testimony. But instead, they left their fishing equipment on the rocks by the lake and left. They never returned to collect their equipment, were never identified and despite numerous appeals by the police, they never came forward. The police gradually ran out of leads and slowly and slowly updates in the investigation stopped being published in the newspapers. Eventually, the police ran out of leads to investigate and the case went cold.\n\nIn the years that followed the locals continued to suspect Karl as the main suspect. Although Karl looked nothing like the sketch his behaviour was still enough as alongside his violent behaviour he sealed up that well of his only a few days after the murder. In the late 60s, his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer and when in the hospital she confessed to a friend that she believed Karl to be the murderer and gave a false alibi to the police out of fear over what Karl would do to her. The police, who were said to have an 80-page case file on Karl by this point visited the hospital to question Karl's wife who retracted her statement. Because she wouldn't make a statement and they had no evidence linking Karl to the murder they officially stopped all investigations of him in September of 1969.\n\nPrior to the closing of the investigation, Karl was sitting and drinking with a neighbour before Karl grew suddenly angered and saddened for no discernible reason. When the neighbour asked what the issue was Karl said \"Don't you realize it yet? I am the murderer behind the Lake Bodom Massacre.\" the neighbour said \"If that's true then go to the lake and drown yourself immediately. Otherwise, you will be locked up in a cell for the rest of your life.\" On August 2, 1969, the police found Karl's body floating in Lake Bodom with the cause of death ruled as likely suicide. As there were no independent witnesses to this alleged confession and on account of Karl being intoxicated and mentally unwell and topped off with a lack of evidence the police did not consider this enough to close the investigation and deem Karl the killer.\n\nAs for Hans, In 1997 he was interviewed by a reporter and when asked if he was the murderer, rather than denying any involvement he said \"I can't disclose the details.\" which was believed to be a confession. One of the doctors who treated Hans also wrote three books about the case and how Hans was the likely killer. They even tried linking Hans to other unsolved cases such as the murder of Kyllikki Saari (he was in Germany at the time) and even the death of a Finnish parliament and minister named Penna Tervo (he died in a car accident but others think it might be foul play). Hans passed away on June 19, 1998, at a hospital in Sweeden\n\nIn 2005 the police finally declassified what info they had on Hans. In 1960 after the hospital called police, Hans was interrogated but they quickly learnt that he had a strong alibi. At the time of the murder, he was staying with his mistress at their apartment in Helsinki as he was having an extramarital affair. He was seen by the landlord, landlady, her mistress's sister and her husband. It was impossible for him to leave without being noticed by anyone and he woke up and made coffee from 6:00-9:00 a.m. the next morning. Which by then would've put him in the clear. The blood on his clothing was red paint, his strange behaviour was due to intoxication and the reason for his hospitalization was stomach pain as his wife had said. The police had Hans's fingerprints on file and in 1978 reopened the investigation to compare them to unknown fingerprints found on soda cans at the crime scene and they weren't a match.\n\nThe public was still unsatisfied and continued believing that Hans was the killer based on his resemblance to the sketch. Many also noticed in pictures at the memorial service taken on June 13, 1960, [that there was a man amongst the mourners](https://imgur.com/mfri4HJ) who looked like the man in the sketch with many believing Hans attended the funeral to relive the experience of the murder. The police, on the other hand, stopped putting much faith in the sketch. It was found that hypnosis could also induce false memories. Olavi was also put under hypnosis and described a similar man but that was 6 years after the fact when the first sketch was already known. There was another reason the sketch was disregarded though, and that being that Nils may have been lying.\n\nIn 2003 with many advancements in DNA testing and forensic technology made in the 43 years since, the case was reopened. All the evidence that had blood stains on them was tested and on March 29, 2004, the police arrested [Nils Wilhelm Gustafsson who was now a 62-year-old semi-retired truck driver and pensioner](https://imgur.com/6alBsuP). The DNA tests showed that the victim's blood was found on Nils's shoes but not his own.\n\nThe police believed that on the night of the murder Nils, heavily intoxicated prepared a pack of condoms and attempted to have sex with Maila who rejected him leading to Nils getting angry and Seppo stepping between Nils and the two girls and was told to leave the tent. Fueled by alcohol, rage and adrenaline, Nils waited until all three were asleep before cutting the tent ropes to trap everyone inside.\n\nNils knew where everyone was in the tent and started his attack. He picked up a rock off the ground and started hitting Seppo on the head with it. Seppo resisted and kept kicking eventually hitting Nils in the jaw through the tent. This caused a fracture which further enraged Nils who took out his knife and began stabbing him several times through the tent fabric in the chest and neck. Afterwards, Anja attempted to leave the tent. Nils saw this and began hitting her on the head with a rock over and over again until she stopped moving. He finished the attack with Maila repeatedly hitting her head with a rock before stabbing her 15 times.\n\nAfter killing the three he collected all the aforementioned items and left the campsite to hide them with the man witnessed leaving the campsite being Nils himself. After he was done he returned to the campsite to cut open and collapse the tent in order to make the crime scene appear more \"chaotic\" and pulled down Maila's pants to make the crime look like an attempted rape and finished by lying on top of the collapsed tent and waited for someone to discover the crime scene.\n\nThe next day the press got wind of the arrest and published Nils's name in the newspaper a 61-year-old woman came forward with a statement. She told police that back in 1960 she was 17 years old and camping with her friends when she saw Nils arguing with others and that this was after the murder. She later saw two men who weren't police officers carrying Nils away. When pressed for more details she was unable to name or describe these other men and possible accomplices.  Nils denied any involvement and accused this woman of lying as he had never seen her and Anja's lyric book with the entries further proved his innocence as they made no reference to an argument and there were no signs of erasing or pages being torn.\n\nThe police handed the case over to the prosecutor who charged Nils with three counts of murder. On April 2, 2004, The Espoo District Court felt there was enough to bring the case to trial. The Trial began on August 4, 2005, with Nils pleading not guilty and the prosecutor was Heikki Lampela (who has had future legal troubles himself) demanded a life sentence. The prosecution repeated the same theory as the police and said that Nils only suffered a minor concussion and accused him of lying about his amnesia to avoid implicating himself. For the trial, [the tent was restored and displayed](https://i.imgur.com/XLrbJiR.jpeg) for the court. This ended up playing a crucial role in proving Nils's innocence.\n\nNils's two attorneys Riitta Leppiniemi and Heikki Uotila began their arguments. They disputed the idea that it was Nils who threw his and Seppo's shoes in the bushes as in that case he would've walked back to the campsite all by himself either barefoot or just in socks. This was an issue because both the soles of his feet and socks were clean and showed no signs of walking that long distance.\n\nThe prosecutor claimed that the tent was cut and stabbed through after the murders to contaminate the crime scene. Thanks to the restored tent Nils's attorneys were able to poke holes in his theory. [Based on the blood stains on the tent all located alongside the location of the stab wounds](https://imgur.com/O9wFTuw) strongly indicated that the victims were stabbed through the tent. The police also pointed out how the prosecutor and police in their theory of how the crime took place also included Nils stabbing them through the tent.\n\nNils had sustained many non-self-inflicted stab wounds which contradicted the police and prosecution's theory that all that happened was Seppo kicking his jaw through the tent. Only blood stains from the four victims were found at the scene and the prosecution didn't believe others were involved in the crime. The defence refuted this claim, only 20 blood samples taken from 11 locations had been tested which meant the police and prosecutors had no way for sure to rule out the existence of a 5th individual. The DNA by that point had also been degrading for 45 years and even if the results were accurate, if the murderer was adequately prepared and attacked from outside the tent, they may not have shed a single drop of blood. The defence also turned the DNA results against them and pointed out how Nils's blood was found in the location where he claimed to be sleeping. They argued that if he was the killer his blood should not have been inside the tent. The defence also relied on eyewitnesses who saw others walking away from the tent at the same time Nils was lying unconscious on top of it.\n\nLastly, while the prosecution called upon neurological experts to testify and they stated that Nils only suffered a minor concussion the defence and their experts thought this was laughable. He had been unconscious for nearly 5 days, suffered permanent brain damage and memory loss and was unable to maintain his balance for weeks after waking up and had to use a cane. The prosecutor and police also never explained where his severe injuries came from.\n\nAs a last-ditch effort, a police officer guarding Nils's cell during his pre-trial detention was made to testify about an alleged confession made by Nils. The officer said that Nils said \"What does it matter?, What's done is done. The worst case scenario is that I will be sentenced to 15 years.\" which they felt amounted to a confession. There was no written statements or recordings of him saying this and Nils himself, denied ever uttering such words. The context of him making this statement was also never stated so the court had any testimony on this disregarded and that it wasn't a valid confession assuming it even happened.\n\nOn October 7, 2005, the six-judge panel reached their verdict. Based on his blood found inside the tent, the impossibility of disposing and hiding evidence with his injuries and a lack of evidence and exonerating witness testimony they found Nils not guilty with the acquittal being unanimous. As the prosecutor didn't appeal the verdict within the allotted 7 days Nils was released and given 44,900 euros in compensation.\n\nDue to the media reporting heavily on the case and labelling Nils as a murderer he stayed inside his house and rarely ever left to avoid anyone confronting him on the street. After his acquittal he attempted to seek compensation from the media and newspapers for defamation but withdrew the lawsuit after he could find any lawyers to take the case. No new suspects ever came forward his acquittal.\n\n63 years later the case remains unsolved.\n\n***Sources***\n\n[***https://web.archive.org/web/20081210112643/http://www2.hs.fi/english/archive/news.asp?id=20040405IE7***](https://web.archive.org/web/20081210112643/http://www2.hs.fi/english/archive/news.asp?id=20040405IE7)\n\n[***https://ermakvagus.com/Europe/Finland/lake-bodom-murders.htm***](https://ermakvagus.com/Europe/Finland/lake-bodom-murders.htm)\n\n[***https://yle.fi/a/3-5744609***](https://yle.fi/a/3-5744609)\n\n[***https://web.archive.org/web/20061216183708/http://www.iltasanomat.fi/uutiset/erikoissivut.asp?k=1038765***](https://web.archive.org/web/20061216183708/http://www.iltasanomat.fi/uutiset/erikoissivut.asp?k=1038765)\n\n[***https://web.archive.org/web/20060501025544/http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/taustat/id15657.html***](https://web.archive.org/web/20060501025544/http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/taustat/id15657.html)\n\n[***https://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2011/12/09/bodominjarven-synkka-salaisuus***](https://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2011/12/09/bodominjarven-synkka-salaisuus)\n\n[***https://web.archive.org/web/20110820092012/http://www.nyrkkirauta.kalsarit.net/\\~mb5196/waldemar/alibi80.htm***](https://web.archive.org/web/20110820092012/http://www.nyrkkirauta.kalsarit.net/~mb5196/waldemar/alibi80.htm)\n\n[***https://www.lansivayla.fi/paikalliset/1740609***](https://www.lansivayla.fi/paikalliset/1740609)\n\n[***https://www.kaleva.fi/bodom-jutun-uutisoinnista-ei-syytteita/2364256***](https://www.kaleva.fi/bodom-jutun-uutisoinnista-ei-syytteita/2364256)\n\n[***https://yle.fi/a/3-11614144***](https://yle.fi/a/3-11614144)","subreddit":"UnresolvedMysteries","comments":177,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/17er4uw/three_teenagers_were_found_stabbed_and_beaten_to/","_row":"25"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-02","timestamp":1696216402,"title":"AITA for not \"saving\" my gf's drivers license and refusing to drive her to and from work?","text":"My (28m) GF (26f) is always late.

I've tried to help her - eg putting her phone where she can't reach it from bed so she has to get up to snooze it, but she literally just grabs it and goes back to bed.\n\nYou try to get her to move her ass and she just digs in her heels and takes even longer.  Her response to people calling out her lateness is \"better late than dead on time\".\n\nAnyway, again, she was running even later than normal for work, and really had to speed to make it.

He asked a few odd questions like where my parents lived currently since I live in the city \"alone.\" I told him I didn't have a boyfriend because I assumed he wanted to be sure I was focusing on my studies, my naive mistake. He then started asking me out very insistently, adding that he had wanted ro talk to me for a long time but that i was so quiet (minding my own business on the bus).\n\nHim: I would like to ask for your number.\nMe: oh... I'm sorry, I can't, I'm at work.\nHim: then would you like to take my number?\nMe: Sorry, I can't, I'm at work.\nHim: If I gave you my phone and you put your number in...\nMe: Still can't.\nHim: Maybe if I ever see you outside of work?\nMe: *Maybe.*\n\nI was so nervous and taken aback that I stayed in peppy customer service mode the whole conversation :( I told him he was too old for me and he said age was just a number, gesturing to him body and asking if there was anything wrong with him. I was so flabbergasted I fawned the while way through. He knows my legal and professional name and probably can guess where I live. He seemed warm and friendly but the fact that he did this and said what he said means he can't be trusted. I told one of my managers and she understood to keep him away from me but my work husband found the whole ordeal hilarious and my work wife suggested that maybe because I can be so hot and cold, my friendliness is more flirty than I realized (last week i was helping an attractive customer and everyone joked that we had been flirting heavily, but i found him a little off and he wasnt my type).\n\nWhat can I do to stay safe or reject this driver without ruining my life?

The digitization of the election campaigns meant that votes could be cast electronically, in the privacy of their homes, and well in advance of the opening of physical polls. Several identifiers, including biomarkers, were used to verify their identity; early votes could be changed at any time up to the closing of the ballot collection. However, in the interests of not singling out anyone with connectivity problems or who couldn\u0019t access an electronic device, in-person voting facilities were open on the big week. Many citizens preferred being part of the herd, and exercising their civic rights among a crowd.\n\nThe results from the large percentage of online voters would be accessible almost instantly, but physical votes from each city, outpost, or colony had to be forwarded by local governments. I hadn\u0019t felt this nervous during my first election, yet the uncertainty of who would emerge victorious today gnawed at me. Polls were indecisive, with turnout from certain demographics likely to play a major part in who was victorious. A major setback was that most human citizens had been barred from participating in the election, which could\u0019ve pushed me over the edge. The soul of Skalga was at stake, in my opinion, and I wasn\u0019t sure how much of our progress Veln could reverse if he took office. His isolationism would bring us further away from humanity at the worst possible time.\n\n*I\u0019ve done everything I can with social media outreach and campaign ads. I\u0019ve visited every major city, and run myself ragged going to rural villages and colonies where my popularity is&subpar. Any voters I could sway in Veln\u0019s strongholds would increase my chances.*\n\nWith the polls due to close in only a few minutes, I found myself watching a compilation of attack ads that Veln had spent significant money circulating on the airwaves and the internet. It wasn\u0019t as if I was innocuous on this front; I\u0019d gone after his meteoric rise as the nominated challenger, claiming he gained the most signatures by inflating his accomplishments within a small colony\u0019s government. \u001cVeln isn\u0019t ready to handle the responsibility of all Venlilkind,\u001d my tagline had proclaimed. I did see my opponent as clever, but someone who lacked a moral backbone or a good vision for our future. My rival was clever enough to claim his platform worked on any scale he\u0019d tackled so far, and slammed my policies by clipping out-of-context quotes.\n\n\u001cTarva has proven that she cannot handle the responsibility for Venlilkind. Her unilateral decisions have given **you** no say in your future,\u001d the ad narrator declared, as images of predator disease patients being led out of facilities by humans played on screen. \u001cShe takes her ideas straight from the new predators. This was her claim about humans\u0019 knowledge of predator disease.\u001d\n\nA clip of me from the debate played on-screen. \u001cThey have a better idea than we do of what\u0019s actually predator behavior.\u001d\n\n\u001cDo you want a puppet leader that trusts humanity\u0019s judgment over our own? Do you think predators have *better ideas* than us?\u001d The footage showed my rival touring an exterminators\u0019 guild on his colony, and signing documents. \u001cVeln is not a follower. He\u0019s a *leader* who will listen to what the people want. You know who to vote for.\u001d\n\nI leaned away from Noah on the couch, and held the remote out of his reach as he tried to cut the feed. Glim seemed apathetic from his position in a reclining chair; the rescue had been taken off my last campaign stops, despite how useful he would be to court the exterminator vote. In his current state, he would\u0019ve done more harm than good to my message. It would look like the Terrans were coercing him into supporting me. The next ad in the compilation rolled, going after me on my ties to Earth again.\n\n\u001cWhile Tarva was running around, chasing the human ambassador, Veln was working for his constituents. Listen to her own words about how much of her policies and recent efforts have centered around Earth,\u001d a different narrator read.\n\nMy eyes were narrowed with indignance on screen. \u001cWe\u0019ve been through many stressful situations together, from nearly getting shot down en route to Aafa, to our efforts to stop the genocide of Earth, to working hand-in-paw with the cattle rescues that my government and his bargained for the release of, and now to our collaboration for the Summit.\u001d\n\n\u001cNot only did Tarva *admit* to negotiating with the Arxur, a true predator scourge that eats our children\u0014and ate her own\u0014she also listed all her accomplishments as things on humanity\u0019s agenda. There is no difference between our planets under her leadership.\u001d Behind the narrator\u0019s words, images played of me running with Meier and Noah, as humans stampeded and smoke rose in the background. \u001cBy her own admission on the debate stage, your goods will cost more because of higher value-added taxes to fund *these* adventures. And for all of that, the question remains: what has she done for you? Is your planet better now than it was six years ago?\u001d\n\nThe clip ended with the words *Vote Veln. No More Federations.* flashing atop a picture of my rival holding a baby Venlil. I couldn\u0019t deny that he was excellent at the political game, and it made me seethe. Noah didn\u0019t want me to wind myself up,  pouncing toward me to grab my wrist. He pried the remote from my grasp, and switched it over to a livestream of a news channel. The human winked, before pointing to a clock on the mantle. I flicked my ear in acknowledgment, hearing activity through my campaign headquarters.\n\nMy diplomatic advisor, Cheln, peeked his head. \u001cRight on time. The polls have closed. I prepared speeches for both outcomes, ma\u0019am, and sent them to your holopad.\u001d\n\n\u001cThank you. Whatever happens, it\u0019s been an honor working with you,\u001d I acknowledged. \u001cHow are the exit polls looking?\u001d\n\n\u001cDepends on the jurisdiction. You\u0019re polling poorly in rural areas, colonies, or the places with the strongest exterminator guilds. Dayside City is leaning toward you, which is good.\u001d\n\nNoah bared his teeth. \u001cThink good thoughts, Tarva. You have a heart of gold; they\u0019d be silly not to re-elect you.\u001d\n\n\u001cMaybe. We both know the amount of change I\u0019ve brought has put me in a precarious position. The polls seem to have slid toward him since the debate; I thought I did well, but those sound bites about humans are hurting me.\u001d\n\n\u001cI\u0019m glad you\u0019ve stood up for us, even when it\u0019s not easy. What do you think, Glim?\u001d\n\nThe rescue offered a blank stare. \u001cI think we\u0019re going to lose. Not because people all hate humans, but because people hate how Tarva is *way* too close to you. And they\u0019re right. You two literally bite each other\u0019s faces.\u001d\n\nCheln pinned his ears back against his head. \u001cWait, what?\u001d\n\n\u001cGlim\u0019s not well. You\u0019re dismissed, Cheln,\u001d I said hastily.\n\nThe diplomatic advisor couldn\u0019t depart from the room soon enough, and he rejoined the larger crowd assembled around a massive screen in the lobby. I would be there when the results were expected to be known, but in this election, it could come down to the wire. Noah seemed aggravated at Glim, despite the fact that the sweet human rarely showed anger toward any Venlil. Even his patience had limits, though he forgot about the rescue\u0019s snide remarks as his eyes darted to our television set. The Terran beamed and pecked me on the cheek, as the 64% who voted early had tilted 50.8% in my favor, compared to Veln\u0019s 49.2%.\n\nHowever, I knew better than to celebrate this early, with it being this close and the rural villages being the ones that skewed toward in-person ballot casting. It would\u0019ve been preferable if my margin here was wider, rather than depending on the last third of the votes to be favorable. I cozied up to the astronaut with unspeakable weariness, shooting a warning look at Glim not to mouth off again. After the unfathomable stress of the past few months, I wasn\u0019t sure I was ready for this claw-biting, long night waiting for results to come in across our space.\n\n\\---\n\nDayside City, the capital and home of the most humans on Skalga, was among the first provinces to send results. 65% of the in-person voters called for my re-election, though I wasn\u0019t sure how much I should read into that. The ones who were Terran dissidents had long since moved out of the city, so if anything, it was discouraging that nearly a third had sided with Veln. Other major cities turned out even less promising results, with me narrowly holding the physical votes in almost all, except for Tonalu City skewing 53.4% toward my opponent. That still padded my lead, and Noah seemed ready to take a victory lap. I respected his optimism.\n\n*I don\u0019t know why, but I\u0019ve had a bad feeling about this election since the day began. Maybe it\u0019s just my nerves&internally, I\u0019m not confident I have the support of my people. Even if I do win, it\u0019s clear from these margins that the planet is divided.*\n\nThat was the last good news we\u0019d had in the evening. Rural villages like Celgel Falls, home to Glim\u0019s aunt, poured in their tepid amounts of votes, but several skewed around the 75% mark in Veln\u0019s favor. While one small settlement wouldn\u0019t have been enough to make a dent in my lead of millions, together, they were eating into the metropolitan vote. These people had always been traditionalists, and were known to be less than cordial with human refugees; lack of interaction with Terrans meant they never had the opportunity to change their minds.\n\n\u001cYou can\u0019t win them all,\u001d Noah had said, trying to massage the tension from my shoulders.\n\nThe issue was that I wasn\u0019t winning any, and that my campaign efforts in those areas didn\u0019t seem to have stopped the bleeding. It was a blowout in every single village, which I could imagine Veln feeling the swing of momentum. The colonies only lowered the gap further, and the numbers made my heart plummet. My opponent had been actively ferrying voters on his home colony, Milna, to the polls, and even been on one of those transports himself to plead his case in his already strongest territory. I thought it had been a foolish play, since he already had their votes as a popular governor, but rehashing his beloved tenure paid dividends. Milna was one of the last colonies to report their totals because they nearly doubled a record in-person turnout; Veln was seen as their candidate.\n\n\u001cVeln is a hometown hero who hasn\u0019t forgotten his roots, if you ask voters on Milna,\u001d Jonek had announced on the election coverage broadcast. \u001cOff of Venlil Prime\u0019s soil, she\u0019s seen as the Governor of humans. Perhaps it would\u0019ve been wise to distance herself more from the UN.\u001d\n\n*Not good. Colonies never feel attached to affairs of the homeworld, but even ones without Veln the visitor are bringing turnout. They have a stake in the humans\u0019 arrival, and the ones who don\u0019t are no more inclined to vote than past elections.*\n\nMy numerical advantage had been millions away from my opponent, and seemed insurmountable to Noah, had shrunk to a sliver as the night progressed. The rural villages whittled down my advantage to half of its original count; the unexpected turnout at Milna was the start of a continuing skid. By the time all colonies had reported, my lead was at a mere 493 votes. I fielded calls from the UN Secretary-General wishing me luck and thanking me for everything I\u0019d done for humanity, which I think was Zhao\u0019s way of saying they thought there was a good chance I might lose. The Earthlings must be scrambling to figure out how to deal with a possible Governor Veln, and they didn\u0019t want to spring goodbyes on me if I was unseated.\n\nJonek perked his ears as the camera, as the news broadcast returned from a break. \u001cHello! If you\u0019re tuning in expecting us to hear who the new Governor of Skalga is, we have one province outstanding\u0014the science settlement of Eliga, which has been under sandstorm conditions and is just making contact now. I\u0019m told we can expect results from them in a few minutes. What an election it\u0019s been! Polling in Eliga has been a tossup, and it wasn\u0019t visited by Tarva or Veln: this could go either way.\u001d\n\n\u001cWe should go outside with the others,\u001d Noah whispered. \u001cGovernor or not, I\u0019ll always love you.\u001d\n\nI wrapped my prosthetic tail around his wrist. \u001cI love you too. If I had to do everything all over again, the only thing I\u0019d change is sending that distress signal in the first place. We\u0019ll get through this.\u001d\n\n\u001cOf course we will! Worst that happens is you retire from public service, and we get to run off together like I\u0019ve imagined for months. That\u0019s not so terrible, right?\u001d\n\n\u001cIt is what I want, but humanity needs me in charge of Skalga, to preserve our close alliance.\u001d\n\n\u001cThe Venlil can\u0019t go back completely, love. You gave us a chance, you made sure millions of people who never would\u0019ve thought about dealing with predators did the same, and you *saved* our species to boot. You\u0019ve done so much; we couldn\u0019t ask any more. Don\u0019t worry about humans, because you\u0019ve done more than your part on our behalf.\u001d\n\nEmotion swelled in my throat, as I marched toward the doorway to enter the lobby with the rest of the staff. These could be my last moments as the leader of Skalga; regardless of what Noah said, I felt responsible for the efficacy of my campaign strategies. How could I justify keeping our relationship quiet to maintain my office if I lost my position to a populist charmer like Veln? How could I have any say in decisions affecting millions of Terran refugees on this planet?  I cared about what happened to the Earthlings; that was the sole reason I sought re-election at all\u0014for their sake.\n\nNoah glanced over his shoulder toward Glim. \u001cDo you want to come with us, and watch the results with the group? We\u0019d love for you to join us.\u001d\n\n\u001cNo,\u001d the rescue mumbled.\n\n\u001cWhy not? You were a part of this team as much as anyone else.\u001d\n\n\u001cI helped Tarva because I owed her my life&not b-because I think she\u0019s a fitting Governor. A real Venlil wouldn\u0019t have argued for&f-for an Arxur to speak at the Summit. I hope Veln wins.\u001d\n\nI flinched at that sudden admission from the cattle rescue. How could he oppose my candidacy, after my policies freed millions like him from abhorrent conditions? I had volunteered to help with the reintroduction program because I cared about these mistreated Venlil. A scowl took over my astronaut\u0019s features, and his fist clenched beneath my coiled tail. Noah didn\u0019t speak another word to Glim, instead hurrying out with me to the lobby. I tried to clear that exchange from my mind, but the sinking feeling that plagued me all day had reached its crescendo. I didn\u0019t have a good feeling about how the votes from Eliga would shake out in my gut.\n\n\u001cMa\u0019am.\u001d Kam flicked his ears in acknowledgement, as we fell in beside him and Cheln. \u001cThe moment of truth. I\u0019ve argued on behalf of your policies, even when I didn\u0019t agree with them. You couldn\u0019t have been more right about humans. I\u0019m proud to have served your administration.\u001d\n\n\u001cThank you, General,\u001d I whispered. \u001cThank you for your service to our planet. Let\u0019s save the goodbyes or congratulations for after we hear the results, though.\u001d\n\n\u001cCopy that.\u001d\n\nAn eerie silence overtook the lobby area, as dozens of staffers saw Jonek scan some new information off screen. The Venlil journalist took a moment to prepare himself, savoring the suspense of the ultimate verdict. The knowing glint in his eyes confirmed that the results of the election were known, before he ever said a word. Eliga flashed orange to signify that it had been tallied on the visual aid map; all we needed was to hear the counts that would usher me into a second term, or elect a new Governor in my stead. It was all I could do not to bury my eyes in Noah\u0019s chest, and press my paws over my ears to avoid hearing. The impending news was almost too much to bear.\n\nJonek cleared his throat. \u001cEliga has submitted its votes, and with the last outstanding province in, Dayside News Feed can now declare the new Governor-elect. After winning the city\u0019s vote by a percentage of 54.6%, the 103rd Governor of the Venlil homeworld will be&\u001d\n\nThe journalist paused for dramatic effect, and my breath hitched in my throat. The election would be delivered with his next words, signaling what the voters had chosen for the future of Skalga. I hoped that, whatever decision they had reached, it would turn out well for both the Venlil people and our sincerest allies.\n\n\\---\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/u19xpa/the_nature_of_predators/) | [Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/16w7un9/the_nature_of_predators_155/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/172779y/the_nature_of_predators_157/)\n\n[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/spacepaladin15) | [Something About Blue \\[New\\]](https://www.patreon.com/posts/nature-of-about-88376972) | [Series wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/hfy/wiki/series/the_nature_of_predators) *|* [Official subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/Dqj4HkRdpw)","subreddit":"HFY","comments":215,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/16zudi8/the_nature_of_predators_156/","_row":"29"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-25","timestamp":1695625671,"title":"Absolutely ridiculous that the link stops before midnight.","text":"I just got off an Amtrak train at 11:50pm, and apparently missed the last train.

I'm not native Bangalore an but I've come to love the city in the last 1.5 years I've been here. And during this time I've come to a realization that the collective greed in this city is the biggest challenge the city faces. I've lived in multiple cities before. Originally from UP, I've lived in Kanpur, Lucknow, Delhi, Noida, Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Bhopal and I've never seen a city as eager to rip you off as Bangalore. From landlords and autovallahs to the freaking government, everyone wants to get their hands on other people's money. The public transport is shit, at best and a freaking diarrhea at its worst. For a city generating so much revenue, the infrastructure is in shambles. And to top that off, there are the concerted attempts to make the city worse by some groups for their vested interests. I mean WTF is wrong with people here. Do they not understand that by doing this they are just driving out the businesses that actually brought the boom to this city. I see a lot on people blaming the IT guys for raising the prices in the city by paying the exorbitant rents but if that was the case, why don't we see the same in Hyderabad or Gurgaon.\n\nBanning carpooling, really. I mean with such excellent public transport, obviously your main focus should be on getting more vehicles on the road. If they were actually serious about the reasons, they could have resolved the issue simply by ensuring that the apps confirm if the registered vehicles have insurance. Carpooling is not a service or a profession so the taxation argument is crap. What's next, you're going the tax the groceries that I split with my flatmates next. If anyone has any genuine arguments to say that this was a good idea, I'm all ears but honestly, I really do feel that this city is run  by goons and there is nothing that can be done about that. \n\n\nP.

You Humans have violated your own Geneva Conventions and therefore must be punished!\" cried out the Suluthi Ambassador, a generally amorphous species that could take whatever shape they chose, depending on their mood. Currently the Suluthi was a roiling mass of gelatinous goo, indicating their anger.\n\n\"Blatant bombing of civilian targets, the execution of surrendering troops, inhospitable living conditions in prisoner camps, humiliating and public executions of captured troops and hostages, the nuking of garden worlds, the detonation of multiple antimatter bombs on several nursery worlds, the deployment of horrendous chemical and biological weapons... need I say more?\" sneered the Elrishi Ambassador as he tossed his datapad down in disgust, pointed ears twitching in disgust.\n\nAs the gallery yelled and jeered at Ambassador Lucielle, all the Ambassador did was stand there with a bored expression.\n\nEventually they calmed down, allowing Ambassador Lucielle to speak in the defense of herself and her people.\n\n\"None of you signed it.\"\n\nA puzzled silence filled the room.\n\n\"None of you ratified it.\"\n\nA few members in the gallery shifted nervously, their species' more refined senses alerting them to the mounting anger from the Human.\n\n\"No other species in the Concordance accepted and applied the provisions of the Conventions when it was given to you.\"\n\nAmbassador Lucielle was now gripping her clenched fists so tightly, she was beginning to pierce the palms of her hands with her fingernails, the coppery tang of her blood becoming apparent to those with keen noses.\n\n\"SO WHY DO YOU ASSUME THAT THE RULES APPLY TO YOU?!\" yelled Ambassador Lucielle, her raged directed at everyone, but everyone knew she specifically meant the Kilgram.\n\n\"What do you mean? The Republic of Humanity is a member of the Concordance, so every legally binding agreement is valid. The Geneva Conventions are no exception.\" answered the Elrishi in the prim and proper voice that his species was known for.\n\n\"I also distinctly remember when they were brought up that many in this Council simply scoffed at the idea of such rules being drafted up hundreds of years ago and believed them to be so antiquated that they were to be considered invalid and obsolete. How convenient that you believe it applies to everyone here now of all times, especially after our recent defeat of the former premier military force in the galaxy.\" sneered back Ambassador Lucielle.\n\n\"So you believe that your own laws do not apply to you in this instance? That you are free to commit such atrocities?\"\n\n\"Free to commit them? Oh no, we'll pay for this in one way or another later. But if any of you had read the documentation like you were supposed to, before carelessly tossing them aside, you would have known that there was an out for any signatory of the Conventions.\"\n\n\"And what would that be? That if the opposing race is not human, Humanity is given free reign to slaughter them? To commit such atrocities that their population may never recover?\" snarled the Kilgram Ambassador.\n\n\"Oh no nothing like that. There is just a VERY clear warning in them. 'The Conventions apply to a signatory nation even if the opposing nation is not a signatory, but only if the opposing nation \"accepts and applies the provisions\" of the Conventions.' You, Ambassador Klickgra, and your entire species laughed at the idea of the Conventions, believing that such things are 'common sense' and that common sense would be all that is needed to keep people in line....\" growled as her hands gripped the table before her hard, noticeable cracks appearing in the normally durable table.\n\n\"You fil-\" started the Kilgram Ambassador began before being cut off by Ambassador Lucielle.\n\n\"BUT YOU ARE NO BETTER THAN US!\"\n\nShocked silence filled the chamber as the Human Ambassador yelled so suddenly and so loudly that the sensitive auditory systems of some ambassadors were blown out before protective systems could be activated.\n\n\"What do you mean by that young sapling?\" whispered Ambassador Nilano, the representative of the oldest still living species left in the galaxy, the tree like Willowans. They were affectionally called Ents by many Humans, a nickname they smiled at with fondness.\n\n\"Sirius III. Rylon VIII. Canus IV. Alpha Centauri Prime. Eta Boötis IX. Pluto. Epsilon Indi V. Edenia. Wolf 359. Arcturus Station. Procyon Prime.\"\n\n\"And what are those exactly?\" asked Ambassador Klickgra nonchalantly, though some noticed his mandibles were twitching in his species sign of nervousness.\n\n\"Garden and nursey worlds that your species pillaged and burned. Stations that were simply massive trading outposts. Targets that this Council claims to be off-limits based on 'common sense', yet the Kilgram blatantly attacked those worlds. Every planet has either been scorched clean or turned into prison planets, where prisoners of war and hostages are routinely tortured, beaten, violated nd sometimes even eaten by the more ravenous guards.\"\n\n\"And what proof do you have of this? There is none because it has no-!\" yelled Ambassador Klickgra before he was once against cutoff, this time by a ping, as every Ambassador present was sent a file that contained detailed interrogations of captured Kilgrami soldiers and guards, as well as video files from the security systems the Kilgram used.\n\nAfter recessing for an hour to review the evidence submitted by the RoH, every member of the Council reconvened back into the Council Chambers, the Ambassador Klickgra being dragged to his seat by security, 3 of which stood next to and behind him to ensure he did not run away as he had attempted to do during the recess.\n\n\"As the Council has seen, the Kilgram Swarm violated your 'common sense' rules first. Human worlds have been stolen, burned or irradiated to the point of uninhabitability. Republic citizens have been stolen from their families. We have found some, but most we cannot find evidence of their. Of those we found alive, many were sexually violated without a care for age, had missing limbs due to either amputations or being bitten off by their captors, or they were found slaving away in mines with little to no protective gear.\"\n\nCasting her gaze around the room, her glare settled on Ambassador Klickgra. \"I could have sworn that slavery, of any kind, as well as the eating of sapient beings was outlawed, if not officially then through COMMON SENSE!\" growled Ambassador Lucielle, shouting the two words so loudly that the Kilgram Ambassador flinched back.\n\nReturning her gaze to sweeping the room, seeing that many in the room were apologetic and in sub-servient positions, she continued.\n\n\"We gave them every chance to prove use wrong. That they were the better people they said they were. We submitted reports on all that we had discovered, as per protocol, yet nothing was done. Every report, every complaint, was swept under the rug. From your reactions, most of you never saw these reports, which only tells me that the Galactic Concordance Security Council is to blame for keeping this from you. If you had been informed as per protocol, the war would have been put on hold until we were proven right, the war ended and reparations would have been made.\"\n\nTaking a deep breath, along with a sip of her water, she continued.\n\n\"Instead...... instead the FACTS were kept from the rest of the Galactic Concordance Council. Meaning that escalation was the next logical step. We gave them one final warning. One final chance to make things right before we pole vaulted over the line. Their systems and the Council's systems can prove that. After they laughed at the warning they pressed on, sealing their fate.\"\n\nSitting back, Ambassador Lucielle sighed before continuing.\n\n\"So yes. We DID raze and irreparably irradiate countless garden and nursery worlds. We DID detonate antimatter bombs on garden and nursery worlds. We did gas whole planets with toxins and diseases so vile Nurgle himself would be proud of us. Yes, we cut down fleeing &amp; surrendering soldiers. Yes, we reduced whole cities to rubble and ash, without regard for civilian life. Yes, we kept what few prisoners we had in horrendous conditions and executed many of them for the slightest offense.\"\n\nAs she finished this part of her speech, Ambassador Lucielle stood up and began clearing her table. As she did so, she continued to speak.\n\n\"We believed that, even though the member species of the Concordance had not signed them that they would still see sense to accept and apply them to any potential conflict we would be involved in. Instead our hands were tied. We could either bow down to a galactic power that was dead set in enslaving us for food, pleasure and manual labor or we could fight back. They wanted to wipe us out and what they didn't wipe out they'd enslave. The Republic outlawed slavery centuries ago, and a peaceful end to the war was no longer possible, so extermination was the only choice left. If we were faced with the same situation again, we would gladly do it again if it meant our survival.\"\n\nShe then reached up, ripped the Ambassador Pin from her lapel and cast it on the floor of the Council Chambers. Everyone stared at either her or the pin in shock. She soon confirmed their suspicions.\n\n\"Since it appears that the Galactic Concordance cannot create or enforce any laws that benefit everyone, while being so incredibly corrupt that the Security Council would keep vital information away from the rest of the Council, information that would have led to this farce of a trial ending before it even began, I see no reason for the Republic of Humanity to continue being a part of it. You may contact us through diplomatic channels but we refuse to be a part of this Concordance any longer.\"\n\nAs she walked towards the door, the entire chamber erupted in a panic as every Ambassador began receiving panicked calls from their respective government and military officials, getting reports that RoH businesses were suddenly uprooting, embassies were rapidly closing down, RoH citizens living within the territories of various Concordance members suddenly uprooting as well, their dwellings being sold for dirt cheap as billions of humans were suddenly leaving Concordance space.\n\nMilitary officials were in a panic as hundreds, if not thousands, of starships of various classes began leaving various ports, stations and formations, only saying that their government had recalled them when an answer was demanded of them.

Of course this is a generalization and this is my experience but I think in general the UK has made it a lot easier to be low consumption compared to the US. In the US I would have to make a conscious decision to choose the low consumption option, here it is more of the default and that has made a huge difference for me to be able to live more consciously and be more anticonsumption. \n\n**Transportation**\n\nThis is a big one. In the US I had a car and basically needed that car to get anywhere outside of the city center. In the UK I have no car and it hasn\u0019t really been an issue. You can use public transport and trains to get to many places, even tiny places that I was shocked had public transport. I know the UK has issues and a long history with its train system, but to me as an American it seems great and I am very happy with it. Here it seems like having no car is the default and you only get a car if you need it, whereas in the states having a car is the default and only those in specific cities can be car-free. \n\n**Delivery/Online shopping**\n\nI think this goes along with the no car needed, but I have basically completely stopped online shopping and having delivery. There are many shops and restaurants within walking distance of my flat so I don\u0019t feel inclined to order anything, since it's easier and quicker to buy it myself. Whereas in the States it was a hassle to get to the shops and battle traffic so I would often order items and food for delivery and end up paying the huge markup.\n\n**Food waste**\n\nNow I shop for only 1-2 days at a time vs a whole week of shopping back in the States. Because I was shopping for a week, plans would change or produce would go bad, etc and I would end up throwing away a lot of food that I didn\u0019t use. Here, since I am only shopping for a day or two at a time the food doesn\u0019t have a chance to go bad and I am always able to use it. This goes along with having shops close to my flat so I can stop by on my way. It's not a huge hassle or chore like it was in the States where I had to plan an entire week of meals, make a list, and then deal with the crowded grocery store, so I don\u0019t mind shopping more frequently now since its easier. \n\n**Heating/Electricity**\n\nMy flat here is much smaller and it isn't an open concept like many homes in the US. I have separate rooms with doors between them and so I don\u0019t have to use as much heating as when I was in the states and you had to heat the entire house. I\u0019ll only have the heat on in the room I\u0019m in and then close the door and it will be toasty in no time. Also, it seems more common here to have your heating lower in general and just wear more sweaters and have hot water bottles for your bed, etc. \n\nAppliances here are much smaller and so use less electricity, my oven, fridge, freezer are all small compared to the US. But this isnt a problem since it's more common to only grocery shop for a few days at a time. Also, I do not have a dryer here and so I hang my clothes. This took a little getting used to but honestly I think it's for the best because I don\u0019t use the electricity and my clothes will probably last longer. \n\n**Reusing/Not throwing things away**\n\nI feel like in general there is more of a culture here of buying nicer items but using them for a long time and maintaining them. Charity shops are common here and it's very common to use them, whereas I feel like in the States I didn\u0019t know many people who went to Goodwill unless they needed to. Since I\u0019ve been here I have mended a pair of jeans, resoled a pair of boots, and re-waterproofed a jacket which are all things I had never done before in the States. It would be much more common to simply throw the item away and buy a new one in the States, whereas here there are plenty of cobblers and alteration shops and people would think it was very wasteful to buy a new one instead of fixing the old one. \n\nOverall I am really happy with my move, living here has made me much more conscious of my consumption and made me live a lower consumption life, I can't imagine going back to how I was before. Let me know what you think or if you\u0019ve had a similar experience. ","subreddit":"Anticonsumption","comments":115,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/17d0fwn/anticonsumption_differences_ive_noticed_between/","_row":"38"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-16","timestamp":1697484068,"title":"Moved to the US (Bend) 3 months ago from Budapest, Hungary (Eastern Europe). Here are my first impressions of the US and Bend.","text":"**Some background:** We moved from Budapest, a big city with 1.7 million people, but me and my wife grew up in a town similar in size to Bend. We have never been anywhere else in the US (except the Redmond and SF airports). I moved with my wife and 2 kids (2 and 4 years olds). Been working for a US company remotely from Europe, and they offered me an opportunity for a visa.  \n\n**First:** everyone is so kind and helpful. I had to go through a lot of bureaucracy, it was especially hard until we received our social security numbers, but no matter the case everyone was very helpful and understanding. It is a bit strange for us that we receive comments and or compliments from complete strangers in the streets or when hiking, but it is very sweet.  \n\n**Bend:** I love the scale and beauty of this town. I like walking, biking around with my kids, going to parks and playgrounds. We go for hikes in the weekend, we have two child carriers, we just hiked Tumalo mountain, we left behind our hiking gear in Hungary and have not bought boots yet, so my wife had a garbage bag between two socks under her running shoes, and I just accepted that my shoes are going to soak on the top in the snow. The kids loved the snow, and we loved the view so it was worth it.    \nOur favorite places in town so far are Alpenglow Park, Farewell Park, Harmon Park, and basically all he riverbanks.  \n\n**Kids/Preschool:** We found a preschool for our 4 year old, and although he does not speak any English yet, he really loves it. The mentality, effort and attention they exhibit at the pre-school really amazes us, especially compared to what we experienced in Hungary, where they did not take the kids outside if it was raining, because \"it is too much work to dress every kid\". My wife was a little worried about our kids fitting in the new environment, and now she couldn't be more happy about it. My daughter is really jealous that her brother can go to pre-school and she cant yet.    \nMy son loves all the big cars around town, especially the trucks (there are virtually zero trucks in Hungary), he was a bit disappointed when we bought a plug-in-hybrid instead of a truck :). When I told him, that there are real monster trucks in the US he did not believe me, he thinks those are just toys, so I am planning to look up some opportunities where he can see a real one.    \nWe were a bit surprised when at our first pediatrician visit they recommended 5 vaccine shots on top of the 10 shots they already received back in Hungary so far, the kids were not happy about it either, but they got some stickers and some pretty band-aids which helped.  \n\n**Transportation:** We were a bit afraid of this part, as we knew the US was very car dependent. In Budapest we mostly relied on public transportation and bikes. We bought a plug-in-hybrid, which my wife uses for the daily trip to the preschool. We use this car for our weekend trips, and this is the only time it runs on gas instead of battery. We bought the car 1.5 months ago and have not pumped gas in it yet for 600 miles.    \nI bought a bike for $100 from Facebook Marketplace, and I've been commuting with it daily for work from Old Farm District to Boyd Acres. I've been very surprised that all the roads have bike lanes, and the smaller roads that don't have any have virtually zero traffic. I feel much safer with a bike here compared to Budapest where it feels they are out to kill you with their cars. This leads to my confusion, that why are so few people commuting with bikes? I am biking from the Southern to the Northern ends of Bend and it is just a 25 minute, 6 miles bikeride around a beautiful town. But I think in total I saw 4 people on bikes between 6-7am in the last months. People in Budapest would kill for such a bike-friendly environment. It is really surprising that I don't see much kids biking to and from school and instead get dropped off and picked up by their parents.    \nWe also bought a kid-trailer for our bikes, so we can bike to the nearby parks instead of using a car.    \nI was really happy about being able to bike, so this way we are not linked together in our commute as a family, or we can spare the costs of buying and paying for a second car.    \nAlso, traffic in Bend is much more peaceful in Bend compared to Budapest. My wife hated driving in Budapest, but now she says she can feel that other people are paying attention, and very few are tailgating her.  \n\n**Shopping:** In Budapest, you have a grocery shop every 500m (sorry, about 1500 feet), so we were used to just grab stuff we needed when we were moving around, and not do big weekly shopping, so getting used to one grocery shopping/week took some time for us. It is strange that all the stores are on the same few spots around town, and you kinda have to go with a car. I was thinking I would do shopping with the Bike+kid trailer but I am not sure if it is safe to leave the trailer outside without locking it? I am a bit paranoid, in Budapest they steal even the locked things :)  \n\n**Food:**  I know I should mention this, but we are mostly cooking at home, and have not tried many places. We loved Jacksons Corner, The Victorian Café, Dandy's Drive-in, Rockin Dave's, Cafe Des Chutes.   \n\nSo all in all, we love Bend and the people here so far. Hope we will be able to give back to the community sometime in the future. Sorry for my bad English, my son already speaks a few English words without the ugly Hungarian accent that me and my wife have... Here is a picture of me in my soaked shoes preparing some snacks for my kids at the top of Tumalo Mountain this weekend:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nappef4f4mub1.jpg?width=495&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41bd5a7365f9e14ab0f47742dad4ab022a5e1dba","subreddit":"Bend","comments":212,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bend/comments/179e7j5/moved_to_the_us_bend_3_months_ago_from_budapest/","_row":"39"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-25","timestamp":1695649353,"title":"Homeless elder population worst since great depression.","text":"[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unconscionable-baby-boomers-becoming-homeless-103000310.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unconscionable-baby-boomers-becoming-homeless-103000310.html)\n\nSo I personally have dealt with this with a family member, they were silent generation and this was before COVID. \n\nI had a family member who got screwed over in a divorce in her late 60s, she was a stay-at-home mom, and worked some but only a small SS check $800 per month. The divorce was due to the husband spending all their assets on stupid stuff. They were also farmers so even when he died it only got her SS up to about 1k per month since farmers don't pay into SS. \n\nBottomline we used government services, but the backlog for elder housing with public assistance in 2017 was 2+ years. She does get Medicaid and food stamps which helps, but in the end the family including myself had to pay for her apartment, transport and utilities. She pays food, gas and incidentals. So we are spending over 2k per month all included.  \n\nWhat I have seen of older boomers is the majority do have pensions, but the ones who don't usually have little to no savings. They are under the delusion SS is enough, which at best was supposed to be 30% of the savings 3 legged stool of the 50-80s. The other 2 legs were pension and personal savings. Pensions are gone so your 401k/IRA/Savings is now 70% of the assumed retirement costs last I read. \n\nI am very concerned that the younger boomers who have only small pensions because they were frozen and may or may not have invested into 401k/403b/IRAs may be very under \"funded\" for retirement. Given the massive spike in costs in the past few years how are people on \"fixed\" incomes supposed to not be homeless?\n\nI am a late Gen X (1975) person but was taught financial literacy at a very young age so I did fine, but even with what I have saved I am still concerned given that by the time I retire, SS will be paying 70 cents on the dollar. \n\nFor the younger people take this as a warning, save early and save often because 1. Time moves a lot faster than you think. 2. Time (compounding interest) is the biggest weapon you have as a young person. I started saving the 15% max 401k at 28 (which sucked and I lived hard), but it also means at 48 I'm closing on my first million in my 401k. It's boring and not sexy but simple compounding interest in a 401k really starts to add up. Now I have more money in interest than I invested. So you can do it, but you just do it as early as possible then  DON'T TOUCH IT!","subreddit":"FluentInFinance","comments":463,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/comments/16rsh8i/homeless_elder_population_worst_since_great/","_row":"40"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-06","timestamp":1696557824,"title":"Passed by a woman who said she didn\u0019t want to ride the subway in NYC because it\u0019s \u001cfilled with people that are&you know.\u001d","text":"It conjured up this mental image which made me laugh, but the actual quote bewildered me because public transport is literally the main form of transportation in NYC, which has had over [4 million people riding the subway in one day five times just in April and May this year.](https://new.mta.info/press-release/mta-announces-new-york-city-subway-set-single-day-ridership-record)","subreddit":"fuckcars","comments":47,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/1710a5j/passed_by_a_woman_who_said_she_didnt_want_to_ride/","_row":"41"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-21","timestamp":1697906433,"title":"And it's windy transport, boy public transport","text":"","subreddit":"CuratedTumblr","comments":32,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CuratedTumblr/comments/17d6oj0/and_its_windy_transport_boy_public_transport/","_row":"42"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-07","timestamp":1696712988,"title":"Why is Texas so against walkable communities?","text":"It seems most cities of any size in Texas have made some attempt to have a walkable downtown... which is cool!

Carbon emissions should be brought to zero, but ofc that's an unrealistic goal.\n\nAnyways, 'Murica. The USA is one of the largest countries in the world with the worse public transportation on the planet. Because of these two factors, this country will never ever reach any level of sustainable energy needs, we're a first world country that is resource hungry. It's unfortunate but it's the truth.\n\nSo this push for EVs, while I do like it for the most part, it's just extremely unrealistic due to the goddamn size of this country. Americans love one thing as much as a Big Mac, and that is FUCKING TRAVELING. Wether it's by plane, car, train... Americans travel like hell. Not only that but commuting is a reality and hopefully with more remote work this eases. \n\nWe also have an outdated af grid system. The grid system will require trillions of dollars and decades to even make a dent to modernize.\n\nAs a result, I think plug-in hybrids are the answer at least for now until battery tech changes drastically. But let's think about it, most PHEVs are starting to get into the 40-50 mile range in pure EV mode which is more than enough for the common folk commuting to work or going out for errands or weekend fun. No range anxiety, no waiting 10-20 mins for the battery to recharge. The mining for lithium is as bad as drilling for oul and also the cold climates kills EV range.\n\nFor the time being, PHEVs are the answer.","subreddit":"Autos","comments":520,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Autos/comments/175jxbt/unpopular_opinion_plugin_hybrids_are_the_answer/","_row":"49"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-05","timestamp":1696513282,"title":"Why do men complain less?","text":"Why do they complain less in general?

Here's more stuff I found.","text":"First post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/17047ko/i\\_analyzed\\_last\\_years\\_leaks\\_in\\_highest\\_detail/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/17047ko/i_analyzed_last_years_leaks_in_highest_detail/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the huge positive reception and even (questionable) media coverage of my last post about rather unknown details I found in the leaks, I kept digging. Here's another list about stuff I found, most of it is very easy to miss when watching the leaks.\n\nI know there's already a 60 page document about the leak. But I'm having fun scraping details together in my own way to compile a list to share with you in a short and readable way, sometimes with my own thoughts attached to it.\n\nThat means there's more to read this time. And as always, add one grain of salt to your salt sprinkler.\n\nHere goes nothing:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) The file size of the dev build was possibly around 80 GB big. My very personal guess is, we can expect just under 200 GB as the final file size because dev builds often only have specific features active which are currently needed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) There are safes. One is in the back of an office. I assume those can most likely be picked and/or opened in other ways. Fits perfectly into the new stealth system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) Underwater weapon aiming is coming. So is directional swimming (you can swim backwards or to the side while aiming).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4) Vehicles lean and move similar to GTA 4 when braking, turning or speeding up. Vehicle physics feel like a mix between GTA 4 and GTA 5.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5) Walking around with an openly carried gun could be enough to already alert people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6) Public transport has those \"Rate your ride\" QR-codes. Given how advanced the player cellphones seem to be, we could be able to scan those. If that's also true, it hints towards a very expanded ingame internet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7) The Vice City Metro seems to have three lines, spanning over \\~24 stations. Even different kind of train cars depending on the line:\n\n* Light Blue stands for \"Vice City Metro M(unreadable)\" It seems to cover the Vice City central area.\n* Dark Blue stands for \"VCIA - Vice City International (unreadable (airport?))\". It seems to cover one half of the city, maybe even leaves the city to some extent.\n* There's also a yellow line. It goes the opposite way from the dark blue line, probably covering the other half of the city.\n* There may also be a gray line which is a regional/international train.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n8) Obviously, all Rockstar studios are working together on this project. Found animation work from Rockstar North, Toronto, Dundee and India.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n9) Credit Cards called \"Shark\" seem to be a thing. Fleeca is also back, plus at least two more which I can't see well enough to name them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10) It's pretty clear what Jasons special ability will be: Marking things of importance during a robbery. I saw jewelry, a safe and a security camera being marked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n11) You can buy gum from gumball machines.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n12) Found a mention of the USA and Canada on a sign and heard the \"Eiffel Tower\" being mentioned in a radio. Surprisingly many real world names. Nothing new in the GTA universe however.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n13) Wi-Fi hotspots. If it's not decoration only I can imagine there being such a system in the game. Fits well into the expanded cell phone/internet thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n14) If you commit a robbery, cops won't show up immediately. It takes time for them to be dispatched.\n\n* If this counts for all kind of crimes and not only robberies, the Wi-Fi/cellphone signal thing could mean, rural crimes are less likely to be reported. Similar to the witness system in RDR2.\n* Robberies and heists will now feel much more like actual robberies because of this.\n* You can communicate with the cops or do cop-related actions as soon as they arrive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n15) Excavators can possibly be driven!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n16) Shooting someone in the head could sometimes still make them move around in a gruesome and way too realistic way before they bleed out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n17) Not only hotels, but also inns could be a place to stay at.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n18) Found an US, Canada and Mexico flag next to each other. They are next to the \"Vice City Neighborhood Enhance(unreadable) Community Center\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n19) I seriously think the map will be bigger than we think. Here are the reasons:\n\n* Mexico and Canada can be found being mentioned or displayed multiple times.\n* Many hints towards a big water part of the map.\n* Other people found out, that the map isn't very big by itself according to the W/E coordinates found in the leaks. That means there's a high possibility for more to see in the northern/southern parts or even **beyond the coast**.\n* The whole projects codename is \"Americas\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n20) Finland doesn't exist. ¯\\\\\\_(Ä)\\_/¯\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n21) Flashbangs, flashlights.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n22) Lions or Tigers exist. Probably only caged.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n23) One event is called \"Police Siren Abuse\". Leaves much room for speculation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n24) Saw someone talking some good news about a person and another person giving a positive response about it. More conversations between NPCs?\n\n* And another: Person 1: \"How's it going?\" Person 2: \"Going badly.\" Person 3: (negative response) Person 4: (response closer negative) Person 5: (conversation\\_line\\_4)\n   * Means that bigger groups of NPC people may form and talk to each other in a way which makes sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n25) Lucia will duck around 40 % lower than Jason if I interpreted correctly what I just saw. Maybe a little far-fetched.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n26) The \"(Vice City) Mambas\" will be a sports team.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n27) Cars will behave differently on tarmac, dirt, deep dirt, gravel, deep gravel and grass. Those are the only confirmed ones, there's surely more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n28) A spear gun will most likely be usable. While regular weapons aren't that effective underwater, a spear gun is. Another hint towards more underwater content.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n29) GPS tracker jammers will be a thing which are carriable via inventory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n30) Same thing with an \"immobilizer bypass\". An immobilizer is an electronic security device fitted to a motor vehicle that prevents the engine from being started unless the correct key is present and it prevents the car from being hot wired.\n\n* It probably won't be that easy anymore to steal a parked sports car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n31) More things we can carry: An auto dialer, a cut-off tool, binoculars, fire extinguishers, pool cues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n32) Beef jerkys in your pants.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n33) Golf balls, golf irons, golf wedges, gold putters, golf drivers. I guess golf is back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n34) When the player sat onto a bike, a text popped up saying \"Discovered Sanches (livery). Means we'll probably be able to \"discover\" vehicles in some way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n35) Assuming vanilla unicorn is back as a strip club brand, I found a second unreadable one and a third brand name called \"Horny's\". More strip clubs, it seems. EDIT: False alarm! Horny's is a burger place. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n36) The player has his own inventory, but there's also a shared inventory between characters.\n\n* If Lucia is your partner, you can put a weapon and a few snacks into that inventory to make them usable for her as an example. I assume that's how it works.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n37) In one clip the map only shows up after the player gets into a car. Maybe we won't have a permanent mini map.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n38) There will be \"Serializable World Events\". Means some world events could have different stages to them.\n\n* Those could function like the blue man icons on the minimap from GTA 4 or Strangers and Freaks from GTA 5. Only that they are world events. Possibly without a map icon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n39) Car parts will be part of a world event and you will be able to pick them up individually.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n40) Horses exist and they are rideable if they don't cut them out again like they did in GTA 5, but I highly doubt it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConclusion: A lot of interesting stuff. I think it's clear that this game will have a much bigger focus on stealing and minor crimes than any other GTA game before. And I'm excited for that.\n\nAlso much more stuff you can pick up individually. GTA 5 was already a step back compared to GTA 4 regarding that. GTA 6 will blow everything out of the water.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother post incoming when it's ready. Note to self: Read R*'s patents next time! More interesting stuff to be found there.","subreddit":"GTA6","comments":207,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/172njfk/2_i_analyzed_last_years_leaks_in_highest_detail/","_row":"51"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-12","timestamp":1697108990,"title":"Fuckin Feds","text":"","subreddit":"schizoposters","comments":28,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/schizoposters/comments/1764e32/fuckin_feds/","_row":"52"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-23","timestamp":1698087939,"title":"Dungeon Life 164","text":"I woke up a bit early today, so please enjoy having an update a little early today :)\n_______________\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe new dawn brings the first official visitors to the lava labyrinth.  I\u0019ve had signs at the entrance saying it\u0019s still a work in progress, but I couldn\u0019t technically force people to stay out.  Still, most stayed away, or were happy to harvest the metals closest to the entrance.  It\u0019s one of those natural things: put a distraction out to keep attention away from what you still need to focus on.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut with the labyrinth being finished, I can seal those nodes behind long looping corridors, so I don\u0019t even need to try to move the actual ore vein.  Slash is hanging out  in the area, playing some music and using his earth affinity to smooth a few rough edges.  The magical and alchemical traps are polished to a mirror shine, metaphorically.  A big shiny trap isn\u0019t something people are going to fall for, generally.  The mechanical bits are a bit more rough, but I think Coda is going to have some unexpected help.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nJello has, somehow, gotten ahold of his designs for the mechanisms, and she and Legs both are working away in Violet\u0019s metalworks to make the parts.  I don\u0019t know if Jello will be able to install them, but just having the parts available ought to make it a lot quicker for Coda to do it himself.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt\u0019s looking like the labyrinth is going to be a goldmine of mana, too.  People don\u0019t seem as inclined to wait for official ODA approval for it, unlike most of the other new things I make.  I can see Berdol in the large group that\u0019s already making their way down, but I think he\u0019s here as a delver, not an inspector.  The lack of Tarl is a big clue for that.  The elf will probably be by in a couple days to do an official inspection, and I\u0019ll see if I can take the chance to talk to him a bit more about the Harbinger.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI didn\u0019t have a good chance to talk about it at the meeting, and I didn\u0019t want to just blurt it out in front of everyone.  The weirdness about what it\u0019s a harbinger *of* is pretty concerning, but I think only Tarl really has any context for it.  Even then, it\u0019s probably just going to be another mystery to shove onto his plate.  I\u0019d like him to leverage some help from the ODA, but he might not be able to tell them about it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEither way, it\u0019s a worry that I can\u0019t do much about, so I resolve to watch the inaugural run of the lava labyrinth.  The trip down is pretty uneventful, even though I toss quite a few heavy things at the large group.  A twinsnake might be scary for a small party, but there\u0019s gotta be close to two dozen adventurers in the group.  I actually manage to pull a good surprise with some of the arcane hands, but once they realize there\u0019s magical manual mischief in their midst, they rally quickly and keep the miners from anything worse than a good scare.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThey all gather outside the entrance, and separate into half a dozen groups.  Berdol speaks up to get everyone\u0019s attention.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u001cAlright, everyone should be familiar with the plan, so do your best to stick to it.  We don\u0019t have much information about the layout inside, so make sure to keep track of where you are.  Teemo has said there are supposed to be a lot of traps, as well as being the domain of the wyrms.  He wouldn\u0019t pull something deliberately deadly, but he\u0019ll still keep what you\u0019ve gathered if you\u0019re beaten, so don\u0019t lower your guard.\u001d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe pauses and smirks at the miners.  \u001cAnd the miners will probably not pay very much for missing out on all the ore in there.  As long as you all keep a good map, the Dungeoneers will pay for info, so keep that in mind, too.  We\u0019ll split up once we can, and hopefully by the end of the day, we\u0019ll all have enough coin to buy something made from the special metals here.  Any last-minute questions?\u001d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNobody seems to have any, and everyone seems eager to get started, including Berdol.  \u001cThen let\u0019s go!\u001d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith a cheer, everyone forms into a single large group again, but now that I\u0019ve seen them split, I can see everyone is sticking close to their specific party, even while in the larger formation.  The smaller groups quickly start splintering at each intersection, and soon they\u0019re all happily exploring the labyrinth.  Most of the groups are taking it slow, going at a walking pace and keeping their eyes peeled.  One group is being pushed by their miners to hurry, three dwarves practically slavering at the idea of the ores hidden in the maze.  Their protectors are a trio consisting of a bearkin with a large club, a changeling that looks like a fire mage, and a goblin with& a lot of crystals?  While I\u0019d guess the bearkin is a berserker, I don\u0019t know what the goblin is.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe typical party makeup would suggest either a ranged attacker, or some kind of support, but I honestly have no idea what the little guy actually does.  I decide to watch them as they delve, curious about how they fight, and if they\u0019ll stumble into a trap in their haste.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe bearkin and changeling lead the way, with the miners in the middle and goblin at the rear.  The berserker is sniffing as they go, and I wonder how much scent can actually tell him.  Can he smell the ores?  If so, he\u0019s going to be a busy bear soon.  With the shifting nature of the labyrinth, he\u0019ll probably be great at finding the actual path.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe changeling is drawing the map as they go, while the goblin tries to keep their impatient charges from doing anything too stupid.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u001cThis is as fast as we can go,\u001d he says in a tone that indicates it\u0019s not the first time he\u0019s had to repeat it with these guys, and expects it won\u0019t be the last.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u001cWe can\u0019t let the others beat us to the ore!\u001d complains what seems to be the lead dwarf, though he has basically no accent at all.  \u001cWe hired you to get us there as quickly as possible, but this isn\u0019t even a jogging pace!\u001d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u001cDo you charge around blindly in a new forge?\u001d asks the changeling, trying to keep annoyance out of his voice.  The three dwarves look scandalized at the very idea.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u001cOf course not!  There\u0019s dangers in a forge if you\u0019re not careful!\u001d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u001cWhat makes you think this is any less dangerous?\u001d rumbles the bearkin, his large club resting easily on his shoulder.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u001cIt\u0019s just a tunnel!\u001d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u001cInside a *dungeon*,\u001d points out the goblin.  \u001cEven if this one is friendlier than most, it\u0019s still a dungeon.  They\u0019re never more dangerous than when exploring a new area, and even more so when it\u0019s explicitly said to be full of traps.  Speaking of, have you managed to sniff any out, Wold?\u001d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe bearkin, apparently Wold, shakes his head with a frown.  \u001cNothing out of the ordinary yet.  I can smell a lot of mana around, though.  Anything magical would be hard to pick out.\u001d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe goblin nods and lets his hand glide across the crystals in his belt, before selecting one.  He gently taps it and speaks quietly, though I can feel mana swirling around him as he does.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u001cBrownie, I have need of your aid.\u001d  Mana swirls around the crystal as the goblin holds his hand flat, and a small figure coalesces.  It almost looks like loamy soil shaped into a pudgy humanoid form, and finishes with a little green stocking cap.  Two small pebbles seem to form eyes, and it makes strange noises at the goblin, who shakes his head.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u001cThis would be torture for nixie, you know that.  We\u0019re in a new place and there should be traps about.  I need you to help us find them.  I offer milk, honey, and bread as payment, once we\u0019re back at the guild.\u001d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe brownie looks like it\u0019s deliberating the offer, but there was no mistaking the look of naked desire in its pebbles when the food was mentioned.  It nods and hops off the hand, and the goblin keeps the crystal held as the party continues.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI watch the little fey as they go, the small thing moving around much faster than the others.  It catches the first alchemy trap, which looks to be an itchbomb, and the party decides to route around it.  It also catches a magical slowness trap, which has me starting to get a bit worried.  It can spot my traps without too much difficulty, which could put the whole concept of the labyrinth in danger.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u001cI still think it\u0019s weird you have to pay your summons, Gerlfi,\u001d speaks the changeling, eying the brownie as it points out another magical trap.  \u001cI mean, you already convinced them to help you, why do you have to keep convincing them?\u001d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u001cBecause they can still say no.  I don\u0019t create them, I just transport a small part of them.  They still have their own motivations.\u001d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u001cHard binding angers the spirits,\u001d rumbles the bearkin, and Gerlfi nods.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u001cWold has the right of it.  They\u0019re fey, not spirits, but it\u0019s the same principle.  How would you like it, Vieds, if you were actually compelled to listen to my good advice?\u001d asks the goblin with a smirk, which the changeling returns.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u001cIt might not be so bad, if you managed to actually give good advice once in a while.\u001d  Wold chuckles as Gerlfi pretends to be offended.  His retort is interrupted by the sound of the brownie finally missing a trap.  Wold and Vieds fall through the floor as it rotates, and before they even land, the trap slams back into place and clicks, disabling it and separating the party.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGerlfi steps forward before stopping himself, not wanting to fall into the same trap, and instead tries to raise his voice.  \u001cVieds!  Wold!  Can you hear me?  Are you alright?\u001d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn the tunnel below, the two groan at the unexpected fall, but they haven\u0019t injured anything.  The changeling summons a small fireball to help light the area, revealing the brownie is with them, too.  Wold\u0019s ear twitches as he hears his goblin friend yelling, and he looks upward as he shouts his own reply.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u001cWe\u0019re safe in a second tunnel!  I don\u0019t see an obvious way back!\u001d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGerlfi looks relieved that his friends are safe, but it doesn\u0019t take long for the reality of the situation to sink in.  \u001cSeparated.  Great.  I\u0019m releasing the brownie!\u001d he yells to his friends, before severing the connection and causing the little fey to vanish with a small pop.  He somehow manages to keep from pointing out how much hurrying helped contribute to the predicament to the dwarves as he explains their options.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u001cWith us separated, we should head back.  I can call on a more powerful fey if you really want to try to continue, but I\u0019ll have to offer it a portion of what you mine.  That also assumes we won\u0019t trip into another trap before then.\u001d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u001cBut& the ore!\u001d insists the lead dwarf, looking like he knows what he should do, but has to fight with his greed to actually do it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe goblin simply shrugs.  \u001cI think we\u0019re not getting it, at least not today.  Right now, the decision is if you want to walk out, or be carried out.\u001d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u001cAnd if we decide to press on?\u001d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGerlfi shrugs again.  \u001cThen I think you\u0019ll be doing it without me.  I\u0019m not in the habit of continuing doomed contracts.\u001d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u001cYou can\u0019t do that!\u001d exclaims the lead dwarf, looking livid, but the slow smile of the goblin stops his bluster in its tracks.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u001cI can\u0019t?  Do you really want to argue the language of our deal with someone who contracts with *fey*?\u001d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe lead dwarf looks like he might, but his companions seem a bit more level-headed.  They clamp their hands over the loud one\u0019s mouth and shake their heads.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u001cNo!  No, that\u0019s alright.  I think getting escorted back to the front gates now would be for the best.  No sense hammering burnt metal, after all.\u001d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe goblin\u0019s smile grows much more warm and much less predatory.  \u001cAh, good!  I knew you were reasonable dwarves.\u001d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[&lt;&lt;First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/sf7fzj/a_strange_opportunity/) [&lt;Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/17bs2ip/dungeon_life_163/?)

I came up with this idea a year ago and was not expecting to talk about it today. As we see here, that has led to confusion, panic, and ill feelings. Consider my explanation, and please keep the discussion civil.\n\nLet me be the first to say that **Mango got some things wrong**. By all interpretations of what he said, it sounds like the US dropped chemical weapons on its ally Britain and threw soldiers into the sea to be evil for the sake of it. This is not the case.\n\nInstead, the US used a limited amount of herbicide agents against the **southeast** in a failed operation to disrupt German logistics during Sealion. The thought is that by creating a temporary supply crisis, the US might buy time to extend its defense and evacuation. The plan fails, Germany wins, and **British agriculture thrives**. Not, as Mango says, long-lasting damage. We wanted to reveal this piece of lore in an event about a child growing up with the after-effects of LN-8 in a rural water supply. This is not some major campaign to toxify Britain but one of a hundred desperate bids to save British evacuees from an otherwise doomed island.\n\nFor those who do not know, LN-8 is a herbicide agent developed during WW2 for use against Japan during the lead-up to a hypothetical invasion. This chemical is known for being the precursor to Agent Orange, but LN-8 is much less potent and needs a high concentration to do long-term damage. This concentration would not be possible during Sealion's duration, not to mention the time spent transporting the LN-8 to Iceland and Britain.\n\nAs for the refugees on the ship, the US's goal during Sealion was initially to defend the island, but when it was obvious the Allies could never retake Britain, their strategy shifted to evacuating as many residents as possible to Canada and the United States. Inevitably, however, the US could not evacuate everybody, and as the Germans approached the final port, desperation escalated. Hundreds of thousands of Britons escaped the islands during the evacuation, but during the last panicked days, I think it's inevitable people would be turned away, try to get on overladen ships anyways, and be kicked off by passengers and crew. This wouldn't be a systemic thing US forces are doing, and it's a one-time tragedy we're depicting to underscore the desperation of evacuation.\n\nUS policy would be to evacuate as many refugees as possible, but what I am describing has historical precedence in the evacuations of South Vietnam, Phnom Penh, Kabul, and more. We wanted to reveal this lore in an event about one of the people left behind welcoming HMMLR during the Civil War. We want to depict these events because they have historical precedence, but we aren't doing this arbitrarily. I hope you'll see that this depiction is more grounded and more acceptable than what might have been previously assumed to be the case.\n\nThe whole premise of a successful Operation Sealion requires considerable handwaving logic and history, and even if these lore additions are imperfect, I hope you can appreciate them as our attempt to flesh out the scenario in US lore beyond just \"the Nazis invaded and won, and now these exiles exist.\" Ideally, we want to characterize these exiles for Britain and USA/OFN content.\n\nI want to avoid some of the accusatory language and unwarranted hostility I saw in the last thread. I hope you can see I am not making these additions arbitrarily, and I am not trying to subvert any public trust, I just want to write a fun scenario. If you have any constructive suggestions or criticism you'd like to share, please feel free to do so below.","subreddit":"TNOmod","comments":247,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TNOmod/comments/170ahrv/no_the_us_did_not_gas_britain_and_throw_british/","_row":"57"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-17","timestamp":1697552617,"title":"Whatever You Do, Don't Look Outside When You Lock The Door At Night","text":"If you\u0019re like most people, you lock your door before going to bed at night. It only makes sense: the world is a dangerous place, and you never know who\u0013or what\u0013might be lurking in the shadows. Back when I was still brave enough to look out my window after dark, I used to think about our ancestors, huddled in caves, wondering if more than just the wind was howling in the black night beyond their fire\u0019s comforting glow. \r\n\nFor me, the most basic human trait isn\u0019t cooperation, tribalism, or even using tools.\r  \nIt\u0019s fear.\r\n\nLike you, I lock my door at night to keep that darkness at bay\u0013\r\n\nBut when I do, I never, ever look outside. \r\n\nIf you peer through the windows of your house or the peephole of your apartment after dark  (and I\u0019m not suggesting that you do) you\u0019ll notice a few things right away.\r\n\nThe first is stillness\u0013if you\u0019re lucky. After all, there\u0019s no reason why someone\u0013or something\u0013should happen to be standing on your doorstep, waiting for you to look outside. Waiting to sneer at you through that thin barrier before they come crashing into your home do what they wish to you and the people you love. You won\u0019t notice anything like that.\r\n\nProbably. \r\n\nIf you\u0019re lucky.\r\n\nWhat you will notice, however, are shadows. It doesn\u0019t matter whether you\u0019re looking out at a carpeted hotel corridor, a freshly-trimmed green lawn, or the ugly welcome mat of your neighbor across the hallway: there will always be shadows\u0013\r\n\nAnd most of the time, they behave themselves.\r\n\nA shift in the shadows, or a shadow where one shouldn\u0019t be. That\u0019s the first sign that something is wrong, but most people aren\u0019t paying enough attention to realize what\u0019s changed. It\u0019s perfectly understandable. Maybe you\u0019re still frustrated by an argument at work, or exhausted from trying to bathe a fussy baby. Given what we all go through every day, why would you notice that the long black shadows of the trees in your yard are stretching toward the dying sunset, instead of away from it? Why would you think that the dark shape flickering above the elevator is anything other than a helpless moth trapped inside a wall lamp? \r\n\nNo, after your quick peek outside you probably feel safe. Content.\r\n\nThere are no unknown horrors on your porch. No insanely-grinning figures are creeping down your apartment hallway, tiptoeing with impossible, exaggerated strides. There are no threats beyond your window, the chain-lock, or the peephole\u0013\r\n\nNone that you\u0019re aware of, anyway. \r\n\nIf you\u0019re lucky, there will be other, more pronounced signs that a change is taking place. If you\u0019re not, well, the shadows might be the only warning you get. \r\n\nI was one of the lucky ones. I had so many subtle hints that something wasn\u0019t right, but\u0013like most people\u0013I didn\u0019t pay attention until it was too late.\r\n\nI was twenty-two that summer, and I\u0019d just moved in with my friends Juan, Paul, and Cassandra. The house was a gray two-story rental on a floodplain beneath the railroad tracks. It was nothing special, but it was walking distance from our college and we could afford the rent.\r\n\nAs often happens with new roommates, it took as awhile to get used to each others\u0019 quirks. \r\n\nPaul had an irritating habit of leaving half-empty mugs and cups all over the house, Juan was an early riser who completed his morning workout to pounding techno music, and I\u0019m sure I had more than my share of personality flaws myself. The only thing annoying about Cassandra, however, seemed to be just how superstitious she was. \r\n\nShe avoided ladders and black cats like the plague; every time she spilled salt, she tossed a pinch of it over her shoulder. I considered asking her if she wore a pair of lucky socks to her exams, but I decided that I was better off not knowing. \r\n\nIt was a windy night at the end of August. Juan was on a date with a girl from our statistics class, Paul had gone to some fundraiser for his fraternity, and Cassie and I had been left alone in the house. She was studying something at the kitchen table, her frizzy auburn hair hanging over her face; I had just come downstairs for a late-night snack. The wind might not even have been all that severe, but in our rattling, tin-roofed rental house, it seemed it. Before I went to bed, I at least wanted to see how bad it was.\r\n\n\u001cWhat are you doing?\u001d Cassandra stopped fiddling with her pen and looked up suddenly. \r\n\n\u001cUh, checking outside? I\u0019m about to lock the door and go to bed.\u001d \r\n\n\u001cWell, do one or the other. Not both.\u001d \r\n\nAt first, I thought I\u0019d missed something. Then, with my hand on the door, I got a sinking feeling. This was probably another one of Cassie\u0019s stupid superstitions. \r\n\n\u001cWhy shouldn\u0019t I do both?\u001d I finally sighed.\r\n\n\u001cIt\u0019s something my grandmother said. She used to say that there are wicked things out there in the dark, searching for a pair of eyes to let them in.\u001d There was a long pause. \u001cLook, I know it sounds stupid, okay? Just do it for me.\u001d \r\n\nIt did sound stupid, and I also felt a sudden need to check on my car, which was parked beneath a half-dead sycamore across the street. I figured Cassie would hear if I opened the door, but a quick peek out the long side window while I turned the key in the lock couldn\u0019t hurt&right? \r  \nIt was a weird night. The trees swayed from side to side like they were performing some kind of macabre dance; below them, plastic bags and newspapers blew by on the uneven sidewalk. The ordinarily comforting glow of the streetlights suddenly looked orangish, flickery and wrong\u0013\r  \nBut at least no branches had fallen on my car. \r\n\nI smirked, said goodnight to Cassie, and went upstairs to bed.\r\n\nMaybe it\u0019s just my contradictory nature, but after Cassie more or less forbade us from looking outside when we locked the door, I started finding more and more excuses to do so. \r\n\nI had to check for a package.\r\n\nI\u0019d left a drink on the porch. \r\n\nI wasn\u0019t sure if I\u0019d left the outdoor lights on or not. \r\n\nThey all came down to the same thing: trying to figure out just what it was about that evening ritual\u0013so familiar to everyone I knew\u0013that had Cassie so spooked. \r\n\nJuan\u0019s theory was that the \u0018grandmother story\u0019 was made up, and that Cassie had been attacked while checking outside her door. Paul, who wasn\u0019t exactly a sensitive soul, assumed that she had some kind of mental disorder. \r\n\n\u001cI couldn\u0019t care less how crazy she is,\u001d he sneered one night, while Cassie was out, \u001cas long as she pays her share of the rent on time.\u001d \r\n\nThe problem was, Cassandra seemed less and less crazy to me with each passing day. When I\u0019d check for deliveries before locking the door, I\u0019d get an awful feeling that someone was watching me from the gloom below the trees across the street. I\u0019d notice it again: the way the streetlights would seem to dim and change color, the way their shadows would reach out for me like long, skeletal fingers. The hair on the back of my neck would suddenly stand up, but I was sure that there was no one there.\r\n\nJust uneven sidewalks, dewy grass, dark silent houses\u0013and those somehow-malevolent shadows that seemed to tilt the wrong way. \r\n\nIt got to the point that I didn\u0019t dare look up from the welcome mat when I checked for packages: I was too terrified of who\u0013or what\u0013I might find suddenly standing in front of me.\r\n\nI know I should talk to Cassie about what I was experiencing, but part of me was still convinced that I had freaked myself out over nothing. And another part\u0013the stubborn part\u0013just didn\u0019t want to admit that she had been right. \r\n\nAs it turned out, Cassie was visiting a friend in another state when the danger began to deepen. Once again, I was alone in the house. I had just turned the key when I heard a loud THUMP against the door. I reversed the lock, pulled open the handle\u0013\r\n\nAnd saw a dead bird laying on the welcome mat.\r\n\n&What the&? \r\n\nI was about to bend down and inspect it, maybe even pick it up, when I saw the figure in the corner of the porch. Even now, I couldn\u0019t say for sure whether it was a person, a monster, or just a trick of the light. Whatever it was, it was bulky, dark, and over six feet tall. I remember something that could have been a leathery wings, or maybe just a black trenchcoat; scarred, bloated skin, like a drowning victim\u0019s; round, hungry, horribly human eyes. I screamed and ran back inside, but no monstrous hand reached through the doorway after me. \r\n\nThe neighbor\u0019s pit bull barked; a light flashed on in the house across the street, but otherwise the night was silent. There was no sign of&whatever I\u0019d seen out there. \r\n\nI turned the key in the lock with a shaking hand and hauled myself upstairs; I didn\u0019t dare to look out the window a second time. I\u0019d barely reached my bedroom when a massive SLAM sent the front door flying open. Heavy footsteps creaked across the floor down below. A hand bashed into the wall, feeling for something, maybe the lightswitch. I froze, too scared to breathe, and heard&giggling? \r  \nJuan and his girlfriend Adriana, drunk and trying to find their way to his bedroom. He shushed her, warning her that his roommate was asleep\u0013but that only made her giggle harder. I let out a sigh of relief and climbed into bed.\r\n\nThe next morning, Juan made breakfast for the three of us. My fears felt foolish in the bright morning light, but something was different about Juan. He watched me out of the corner of my eye as I ate, like there was something he wanted to tell me. When Adriana finally scurried off to the bathroom, he leaned over and asked in a low voice if I knew the big guy who\u0019d been standing on our porch the night before. \r\n\nLater, in my bedroom, I noticed a pair of massive, greasy handprints on my window. \r  \nThat night, I did the opposite of what I should have. After sunset, I left the porch light on, obsessively peering the long, narrow window beside the door each time I passed. \r\n\nNothing, nothing, and more nothing. \r\n\nA distant rumble of thunder announced the arrival of a late-summer storm. Paul was upstairs catching up on Chemistry homework; Juan was taking a shower. As the rain began to fall, I felt very, very alone. I hadn\u0019t told the others about what I was going through. I had mentioned something about a suspicious character who I\u0019d seen hanging around the house, but left it at that. The truth was, I would have taken any explanation\u0013a stalker, a prank, or even that I was going crazy\u0013rather than believe that any of it was really happening. \r\n\nI checked out the narrow doorside window yet again: it was hard to see in the dark and rain&\r\n\nWait.\r\n\nDark? Rain? What about the porch light?! \r\n\nA huge, horrible eye blinked back at me. The face it belonged to was large enough to take up the entire window, blocking out the light. I fell backwards with a shriek. \r\n\nRunning footsteps. Juan, naked except for a towel wrapped around his waist; Paul, pale and irritated that I\u0019d broken his concentration. I stammered something about \u0018some guy\u0019 on the porch\u0013\r  \nBut of course, there was no one there when Juan opened the door, one fist around his tiny towel, the other up in the air like he was ready to fight the devil with it. \r\n\n\u001cJust my luck to move in with a bunch of nutcases,\u001d Paul muttered under his breath, and stomped back to his room. Juan shot me a worried look, then closed the door and locked it. \r\n\nStill shaking, I went back to my room and sat in the dark, my fist white-knuckle tight around the baseball bat that was the closest thing to a weapon that I owned. I thought seriously about trying to buy a gun, but background checks in my state take at least forty-eight hours&and I wasn\u0019t sure that I had that long. And what about Cassie? \r\n\nI should have thought of it before. She was the one who had mentioned the weird superstition in the first place; maybe she would have some idea what was going on. I pulled out my phone and gave her a call\u0013then another. She didn\u0019t pick up.  \r\n\nI wasn\u0019t surprised: she was probably enjoying a night out with the friends she was visiting. Outside, the rain fell harder, crashing in torrents against our rental\u0019s tin roof. In other circumstances, it might have been a soothing sound, but not being able to hear what was going on in the rest of the house was making me nervous. \r\n\nWith my hands still wrapped around my baseball bat, I lay down on my bed and waited for what would come next. \r\n\nThe buzz of my phone jarred me from sleep so roughly that I nearly hit myself in the face with my own makeshift weapon. Cassie. I picked up right away.\r\n\n\u001cHey. You called?\u001d Rumbling, voices, announcements over an intercom. She was in public transport somewhere, and her voice sounded like it was echoing down a tunnel. I don\u0019t think she understood my incoherent explanation of the strange events around our house, but she could hear the fear in my voice. For a long moment, I heard nothing but background noise.\r\n\n\u001cI\u0019m sorry.\u001d Cassie said, like a doctor giving a terminal diagnosis. \u001cIf it\u0019s gotten that far, then it\u0019s already too late.\u001d\r\n\nDownstairs, the doorbell rang. I double checked my phone screen. It was after three AM! No one should have been visiting that late, and yet\u0013 \r\n\nSounds of movement: Juan.

Her scanty, secondhand possessions were worth next to nothing, and gave us no clue of who she\u0019d been or where we\u0019d come from. The college refused to help with our search. Her information was private; if there were no signs of foul play, she would simply be filed away with all the countless other students who had suddenly dropped out, with no notification, for reasons of their own.\r\n\nThe local police, meanwhile, acted completely unconcerned about Juan\u0019s disappearance. During the smoke break they took on our porch, I overheard them joking about how my med-student roommate had probably just been deported. \r\n\nI moved out too, of course. I cared more about avoiding the next horror that might happen in that house than I did about breaking a lease, and I crashed on couches until I found a free room. Paul continued living in the rental, muttering about broken promises and New-Age crazies. Eventually he got new roommates, and to the best of my knowledge, none of them ever looked out the window before locking the door. \r\n\nSince then, neither have I. \r\n\nThere have been a few close calls.

These countries are hailed as advanced. Due to these policies, people don't need to save as much money for a rainy day and instead spend more stimulating the economy, resulting in further growth. \n\nIn India, any such action is called a \"freebie\" and looked down upon. In Karnataka there is free public transport for women. Sure, there is a cost associated with it. But are we so blind that we can't see the huge addition to the economy if millions of women go out and work instead of sitting at home? What is the problem with reducing the barrier to leave the home? \n\nIt seems like a plague of the rich, privileged, city population to have a problem with such things, since they have neither experienced the challenges of not having it, nor the benefit of the government making an effort to provide.\n\nEdit, based on the discussion, in summary it seems:\n\n1. The word \"freebie\" itself is politicised and disingenuous. The same concept is called \"welfare\" in many other countries and is hailed as positive.\n\n2. Even if it doesn't support them directly, people here support welfare. They only want it to be thought through economically. This is absolutely 100% a fair viewpoint!\n\n3. There is a common misconception that 98% of India doesn't pay tax. And 2% of hard working tax payers are living miserable hard lives supporting the rest.\n\n100% of this country pays tax. Maybe not income tax, but on every purchase, on every food grain bought tax is paid. And if you think you're living a harder life than the 98% of the country that lives in poverty and often doesn't have food to eat, you're delusional. \n\n\"Oh but my uncle's friend's brother is a farmer who earns 100cr and doesn't pay tax\". Yeah sure, but the point is about statistics. In general, farmers are poor, so in general they don't pay tax. Policies in large scale are all about \"in general\". Exceptional cases are bound to come up with large scale policies, but in general, it works. \n\n4. India is moving towards a system where people are demanding more basic services from government. This is not just free electricity and water, but also more development of roads, infrastructure, and environmental protection. This is good! \n\nYes there will be mistakes along the way, and some policies will undoubtedly fail. But on the whole, let's keep demanding better from policy makers, let's keep the criticism up, and we will push the government to do better. Keep the pressure up guys, on both sides of the debate! \n\nDebate is essential to democracy.","subreddit":"india","comments":344,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/17brlmw/india_why_the_double_standard_with_freebies/","_row":"59"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-30","timestamp":1696058566,"title":"I love Copenhagen","text":"My wife (33)  and I (32) spent about 10 days in Copenhagen.

She does not drive. Its too much work and makes her anxious.

It is now known a RAAF Woomera Range Complex (WRC), the ground within is called Woomera Prohibited Area (WPA), and the air above, Woomera Restricted Airspace (WRX).  It also houses a military airfield RAAF Base Woomera, which has been in operation since an RAF Dakota landed there June 19, 1947.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Map of Woomera Test Range in Australia](https://preview.redd.it/3eavmb0hnvtb1.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e2086ed82475fd25bde2df627b89180ef7edf36)\n\n**It was founded in 1947** \\- of all the years in history to be tied to a UFO mystery, '47 is about as good as they get. Most of you know this, but for the uninitiated, some highlights:\n\n* Ghost Rockets - Through '46 &amp; '47 - Reports from Europe of mysterious, rocket-like objects that catches the attention of the US military.\n* White Sands UFO - April 24, 1947 - White Sands Proving Ground employees report a UFO, investigated by Military personnel.\n* Harold Dahl/Maury Island Sighting - June 21, 1947 - Sighting that goes viral and sparks national UFO conversation\n* Kenneth Arnold June 24, 1947 - Coins the term 'Flying Saucer' after his sighting goes viral\n* Alleged Roswell Crash - July 8, 1947\n* Chiles-Whitted UFO - July 24, 1947 - Thomas Mantell and Clarence Chiles, with John Whitted, report a UFO. Mantell chases it in his aircraft and dies.\n* Twining Memo - September 23, 1947 - Allegedly written by General Nathan Twining, head of USAF Air Materiel Command, to Brig. Gen. Shulgen describing that the UFO phenomenon is real and not visionary or fictitious.\n* Gorman Dogfight - Oct 1, 1947 - George Gorman reports an encounter and \"dogfight\" style manuevers with a UFO in Fargo, ND.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWoomera was a collaboration between the UK, Australia, and the United States.  It's stated purpose was a secure facility for the testing of British and US weapons in a vast, sparsely populated area - specifically, missiles, rockets, and other aerospace technologies.  It grew into a facility that also has launched satellites, high-altitude balloon flights, and scientific research.  It has been operated jointly by the UK, Australia, the US, and their defense agencies.  It is still in operation today.\n\nIt is now known as RAAF Woomera Range Complex, operated by the Royal Australian Air Force.  It covers over 47,000 square miles.  **It is equipped with facilities for tracking and monitoring spacecraft, and has served as a strategic defense facility for tracking of satellites and high-speed missiles.**\n\nIn the 1960s, **Woomera served the laudatory function of space exploration, launching scientific and research payloads into orbit**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[You're not welcome here](https://preview.redd.it/sdlzsjavrvtb1.png?width=384&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e9d500aa390baaa589b1ac888a7059136606a21)\n\nWoomera is divided into several key facilities:\n\n1. Launch &amp; Impact Areas - missiles &amp; rocket launches and fall zones\n2. Control &amp; Command Centers - **Equipped with advanced tracking, telemetry, and communication systems** for the analysis of test flights.\n3. Range safety facilities - monitoring stations, emergency response, and safety officers to enforce strict protocols.\n4. **Tracking &amp; Telemetry Systems -** Woomera's comprehensive network of tracking &amp; telemetry systems employs radar, optical instruments, and other sensors to **monitor trajectory, position, and performance of objects flying over Woomera.**\n5. Aerospace Test &amp; Evaluation Facilities - specialized facilities such as **wind tunnels, environmental test chambers, and instrumentation laboratories,** engineers and scientists simulate and assess the performance of missiles, rockets, **and space vehicles**.\n6. Space Tracking &amp; Data Collection\n7. Support Infrastructure - personnel buildings, equipment, logistics, workshops, maintenance hangars, manufacturing facilities, fuel storage, and transportation.\n\nFacts about Woomera:\n\n* It is the largest land-based test range globally (at one point, it contained over 100,000 square miles, before downsizing).\n* Woomera is an Aboriginal device described as \"the most efficient spear-throwing device, ever.\"\n* Surrounded by vast uninhabited land, making land approach nearly impossible without purpose.\n* Unauthorized aircraft cannot enter the area.\n* Woomera is surrounded by cutting edge surveillance systems.\n* Areas within Woomera are separately controlled by specific clearances.\n* Many of the buildings are within self-contained restricted zones and hardened against attack or explosive threat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTies to space programs:\n\nIn the 1960s, Woomera participated in the US's Mercury and Gemini Space programs, as well as earlier Ranger &amp; Mariner missions.  Specialized tracking and communication stations were established at Woomera, and were used during the first moon landing. (Island Lagoon Tracking Station / Deep Space Station - 41 \"DSS-41\"). This facility was operated by NASA.  It was shut down in the 70s. New facilities have since been constructed in the area.\n\nAustralia launched its own satellite in 1967 from Woomera called \"WRESAT\" or \"Weapons Research Establishment Satellite\", becoming the 3rd country in the world to launch a satellite from its own territory into space, after the Soviet Union and US.  During the Cold War, Woomera launched more space rockets than anywhere else in the world other than Cape Canaveral.\n\nToday, Woomera is in the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) hall of fame, with a plaque commemorating its contributions to aerospace on par with Kitty Hawk.  Recently, in 2010 and 2020, Japanese space probes who collected samples from Asteroids (Hayabusa and Hayabusa2) were plummeted into the Woomera Range for recovery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[DSS-41, December 1961](https://preview.redd.it/hkt0ialivvtb1.png?width=1041&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=200cd5e2eba974616f885c1afe949036ff6acc00)\n\nTies to Aerospace R&amp;D:\n\nIn the mid 90's, the RAAF Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU) in conjunction with the Defense Science and Technology Organization (DSTO) took over total operation of Woomera.  ARDU was formed out of the No 1 Air Performance Unit, and renamed to ARDU in, you guessed it - September 1947.  Its role is primarily testing of new and classified aircraft, not unlike the mission performed at Area 51 and Area 52 in the US.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nContractors:\n\nIt's difficult to find information about what contractors were engaged with Woomera in the past. In modern times, Woomera has participated in large scale contracts with Raytheon, BAE Aerospace, and others. Lockheed Martin has a presence on Woomera Ave, in Edinburgh (near Adelaide, the major city south of Woomera Range).  In 2020, Australia allocated nearly $1b to upgrade Woomera.  In 2020, the chair of the WPA Advisory Board, was Amanda Vanstone, board member of Lockheed Martin Australia (though she was not on the board in 2017 when elected; Lockheed hired her in 2018).\n\nI have found LinkedIn profiles of USAF personnel who were stationed at Woomera within the past twenty years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what building is it at Woomera?\n\nThis I'm not sure on.  It could be one of the Launch Complexes, though dubious that they would then launch actual rockets off the top of it:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Woomera Launch Pad 6A](https://preview.redd.it/fx1p0o500wtb1.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2c7c9a49f1dbc6989ffc50d8e03e79445384ffb)\n\nAs far as I can determine, the first launch pad was not constructed until 1957 - meaning if something was found earlier (likely by the Survey Corps of Australia who were looking for a test range, but perhaps stumbled across something more interesting?), this isn't a good candidate.\n\nIt's quite difficult to get details on specific buildings.

Lots of cycle paths, wide sidewalks, lots of greenery, accommodation with photovoltaic panels, heat pumps, frames/double glazing and argon inside windows and thick external walls with thermal coats.\n\nHowever, cars are not banned from this neighborhood (unlike in the center of my city), they simply have a slightly smaller street with raised pedestrian crossings and few parking spaces. That said, even if there were zero parking spaces, the neighborhood is not large and is surrounded by streets full of parking spaces. Furthermore, many residents have a garage and/or at least one private parking space.\n\nYesterday, however, speaking to my neighbor he complained that there are few parking spaces and that when they finish the neighborhood and there are even more people here there will be even fewer parking spaces.\n\nIt's not a neighbor I know well (otherwise he would have known that I don't even own a car, I only get around by push scooter or bike) and when I told him that I thought there were more than enough he almost attacked me.

They want to have parking under their house and even attack people verbally if they think you want to take away this right from them (or even refuse to use it, my father was there and he \"dared\" to say that he will leave the car outside... my neighbor was shocked \"you will never find a parking space here... Why didn't you buy a private parking space?\"). Not only that, I thought whoever bought here was very environmentally friendly like me. After all, the houses (or rather apartments/condos) here are expensive but not large because they use a whole series of methods to avoid losing heat and save energy. I thought it was obvious that there were fewer people interested in cars, but that's not the case at all, most of them are just rich people that want to show off their new thing....\n\nAnd this happens here, in a town with decent public transport and neighborhoods like this and the center that are much more pedestrian than car centric.\n\nYesterday I said to myself, there is no hope... Then I said to myself that maybe logic isn't a good way to change people's mentality.\n\nWhat solutions do you think are effective?\n\nPersonally speaking the only one that comes to mind is forcing people by banning cars or making them pay so much that they are forced to choose between having a car and having a house. In this way the next generation will inevitably have to get used to it.\n\nI have no other ideas. Is there any alternative to a \"dictatorial\" approach?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS. I've read and responded to as many posts as possible but I can't keep up anymore. You can tell this community is really passionate and given the amount of messages from all over the world I really hope this means the future will be better. Thank you all for the advice, some of it really interesting. I will try something more hoping to be able to convince as many people as possible to give up their cars or at least to be reasonable and walk 5 minutes to get to a parking space outside of our new great neighborhood.  \nI have to turn off notifications for this post for now, but I still thank everyone for participating.","subreddit":"fuckcars","comments":149,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/16tesrn/logic_doesnt_exist_we_need_to_find_another_way_to/","_row":"66"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-03","timestamp":1696358275,"title":"Lady asked me to give up my seat","text":"It had been a while since I had taken the bus in London, but I had walked more than I usually would be comfortable doing in a day because of an orientation activity, so I took the bus for a short ride to the train station to catch the train.\n\nSome context, I am disabled. I have an invisible disability, as I have End stage renal failure and on nighttime dialysis. I get fatigued easily and even more so when carrying heavy stuff. Of course, I don\u0019t look like it. I\u0019m a university age student and look as young and fit as any other.\n\nSo I board the bus and there are two seats empty near the front, both on the aisle, one is marked clearly disabled, one isn\u0019t. So to avoid being seen as an asshole I chose the one that isn\u0019t. Except on this side there happens to be a young mother with a buggy and a young child in it. I didn\u0019t notice at first, but shortly after I sat down, an older woman (of course it\u0019s always an older person) in row behind me kept tapping my shoulder.\n\nI was quite confused at first and didn\u0019t know what she meant, but she kept gesturing to the woman with the child and said she might want to sit. So I reluctantly looked up and feeling pressured, offered my seat. Fortunately she didn\u0019t want to sit anyways.\n\nNow I don\u0019t know, but I came out of all of this with quite a sour taste in my mouth. Of course the old lady wanted to be considerate of the woman with the baby, but she had chosen not to take a seat for multiple stops until that point. And she had no way of knowing I was disabled myself. But I just felt like there was no winning in this scenario. No matter where I sit I am going to feel like I don\u0019t deserve to just because I have an invisible illness. What if I moved across to the disabled seat? Would I have gotten rude stares? If there was no other seat left and I was truly exhausted would I have been continuously pressured to give up my seat?\n\nI don\u0019t know, all of this just puts me off even further of taking public transport.","subreddit":"CasualConversation","comments":93,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/16yzr19/lady_asked_me_to_give_up_my_seat/","_row":"67"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-09","timestamp":1696869866,"title":"[OC] Average monthly income and expenses as a swedish remote worker living in barcelona","text":"","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","comments":184,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/173wiy5/oc_average_monthly_income_and_expenses_as_a/","_row":"68"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-22","timestamp":1697978503,"title":"Why I find Poland impressive","text":"A few thoughts.

A brand new looking tram line.\n\nWent on to Warsaw saw a fantastic metro witj with new lines and Siemens carriages (Dublin still doesn\u0019t have one >r).\n\n- Many Polish immigrants in Ireland. They have a very good reputation for being hard working people. Integrated very well. Honest people kind &amp; hearted. Not sure if Polish people are aware of that.\n\n- biggest thing I found interesting is how you made peace with the Germans. In Ireland we are guilty of knowing too much of our history and having resentment towards the English a little bit. The atrocities that happened to us were many years ago but with Poland it was extermination in living memory.  Poland suffered some of the most awful crimes of the 20th century happened and you have productive relationship with Germany. Poland Germany reconciliation can show its possible for other countries. \n\n- I went to school with many Poles. They all made full use of the education system and a couple went back to have kids but all the ones I know have great jobs. Very few lazy ones. All willing to work and have a good attitude.\n\n- Poland like Ireland went from a backwards poor country to a developed rich country within a generation. Poland is probably 10-15 years away from being as rich as UK, France, Germany. I see the same journey only we maybe did it just slightly before you. You got held back by communism.\n\n- European security. In Europe we are partners and allies and it\u0019s good to see nations apart from France/Germany begin to have influence. Europe is big enough for many voices.\n\nI\u0019m very much a pro-EU person and I find it one of the strongest arguments that it gave you guys the tools to lift yourself out of the hole and become just as good as any other nation and escape the clutches of empire.

They act like a catcaller in the street is some serious threat to women's existence. Here's the issue: many catcallers don't view themselves as harassers. In one [survey](http://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMAGES-MENA-Multi-Country-Report-EN-16May2017-web.pdf), many of them said they did it just for kicks or they think it's funny to relieve stress, but many in another [survey](https://www.psypost.org/2021/09/men-who-catcall-claim-its-a-normal-way-of-flirting-while-at-the-same-time-demonstrating-greater-hostile-sexism-61805) usually said they did it to flirt or flatter a woman. They usually expected that women were flattered by their statements and viewed it as complimentary rather than harassment or saw it as a normal way to ask a woman out. Maybe educating these guys about what is a normal way to flirt vs harassment is better to stop this than treating them as potential rapists. These men did score a bit higher on hostile sexism, but not that much higher. *Most of these men aren't going to hurt anyone though, so we need stop thinking they will*. For example, most stranger/street crime victims are men, and most rapists are someone you know, and [many street criminals even say they refuse to attack women](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/16unca5/some_statistics_that_show_many_male_criminals/), and that there's a code against it in street crime culture. Most male criminals harm men.\n\nNonetheless, women often have a biased interpretation of whether a catcall is uncomfortable or not. In a [survey](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kimberly-Fairchild/publication/225564287_Context_Effects_on_Women%27s_Perceptions_of_Stranger_Harassment/links/53e4eaa00cf2fb748710fd8b/Context-Effects-on-Womens-Perceptions-of-Stranger-Harassment.pdf) of women about street harassment, they found most catcalls usually just involve whistles, stares, sexual comments or comments about their appearance. Grabbing or fondling was relatively unusual. Typically, they considered it uncomfortable if they were alone or it was nighttime. Some said it was uncomfortable if it was on public transportation or the streets, but it was less uncomfortable if it was when she was walking with people or during daytime. They also sometimes said they enjoyed it if it was an attractive catcaller or if she was with her friends. In fact, she sometimes found it more scary if an ugly catcaller did it or an older catcaller did it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r4wdaxm87ttb1.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef980761866aea1dc242220c0704fc02d376f6b6\n\nIn another [survey](https://stopstreetharassment.org/our-work/nationalstudy/shage/), few women said the age of harassers didn't matter. Most said it was mostly older harassers who made them uncomfortable or that if it was someone their age they wouldn't care. I'll admit, some of these women were talking about experiences when they were underage, but even adult women online complain about an older man complimenting them whereas a man their age could make the same compliment and it's now okay. Long ago in time, unless she's a little kid, women didn't care if an older man made a compliment, and instead, women were more uncomfortable if it was a black man instead.\n\nAnother [study](https://rdw.rowan.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&amp;context=titleix) on female college students found that their perception of sexual harassment in online dating depended on the attractiveness or status of the man. Although an attractive or rich man who harassed them was viewed less positively than attractive or rich men who didn't, they were still viewed in a relatively positive light. Ugly or poor men were viewed much more negatively after engaging in harassment. This shows there must be a halo effect.\n\n**This doesn't defend sexual harassment, but shows how people can be biased in what they call harassment unless it's very overt harassment.**","subreddit":"MensRights","comments":97,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/176d03s/what_women_define_as_sexual_harassment_or/","_row":"73"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-03","timestamp":1696359441,"title":"[K-pop] The divorce of the century: the rise and fall of Yunjae, K-pop\u0019s most (in)famous ship (PART 1)","text":"Or: the story of two men, the people who wanted them to fuck, and how they'd forever alter Kpop.\n\n# Introduction\n\nIf you know anything about Kpop besides the music, it's probably something about the fans. Kpop groups are well known for having legions of incredibly dedicated fans, who are willing to go above and beyond for their idols. One thing that brings a lot of fans of the same group together is shipping. If you're not familiar with the concept of shipping, I'm honestly impressed. The kind of shipping we'll be talking about here is the shipping of real people (also known as RPF). In Kpop, this usually manifests as fans really liking the relationship between two (usually male) K-pop idols, and then thinking they should fuck. There's a lot of popular Kpop ships out there, and they all have their own devoted group of supporters. But today we're gonna be talking about the Kpop ship that would go on to define Kpop fanservice, fandom, and shipping for the next two decades: Yunjae.\n\n*Disclaimer: I do not ship Yunjae. I have never shipped Yunjae. This is not an essay on why I believe Yunjae is real. I am not Korean, I do not speak Korean, and I was not into TVXQ when all of this occurred. I have done my best to make sure all my information is sourced and legit, and to specify when it is not or when there may be translation errors. I am also not writing this to try and say every Yunjae shipper is as I have described or vilify shippers. I just want to detail some of the insanity that Yunjae shippers helped perpetuate.*\n\n**Background information**\n\nBefore we can get into what Yunjae even is, we need to talk about the group our leading men debuted in: [**TVXQ!.**](https://imgur.com/a/Jws41oX) **TVXQ** is an acronym for *Tong Vfang Xien Qi*, which means \"rising gods of the east\" in Chinese. In Korea they're referred to as Dong Bang Shin Ki, or DBSK. In Japan they are known as Tohoshinki, or THSK. All of these names mean the same thing, and for consistency's sake I'll just be referring to them as TVXQ throughout this, unless I'm specifically talking about their activities in Japan.\n\nTVXQ debuted as a 5-member boy group in 2003, with their first performance being at[ a Britney spears showcase, of all places](https://youtu.be/sWWkeSAtZEI?si=BEy1ZqLjaTik1stR&amp;t=3412). [This write-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/hrgzss/kpop_the_most_divided_kpop_fandom_tvxq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) does a really good job of explaining their history as well as their eventual fate, and I strongly recommend looking at it. I'll do my best to sum up what you need to know about TVXQ in order to understand what's to come:\n\n* At debut, the members of TVXQ were, in Lastname (*Stagename*(s)) **Firstname** format:\n\no [Kim (*Xiah/Xia*) **Junsu**](https://imgur.com/a/qqsoJZq)\n\no [Park (*Micky*) **Yoochun**](https://imgur.com/a/HBUlXya)\n\no [Kim (*Hero/Youngwoong*) **Jaejoong**](https://imgur.com/a/BxHCVTp)\n\no [Shim (*MAX/Choikang*) **Changmin**](https://imgur.com/a/sj9Uqlk)\n\no [Jung *(U-know*) **Yunho**](https://imgur.com/a/oXFDHdF)\n\n* Yes, they *do* have a lot of stage names. Yes, they *do* go by all of them. Because I don't hate whoever is reading this *that* much, I'll just stick to using their first names.\n* TVXQ tend to stand in the [same order](https://thebiaslistcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/tvxq-hug.jpg?w=640) in [group photos](https://i.imgur.com/l5pCWrM.jpg), which is the same order I've listed the members in. Jaejoong is nearly always in the [middle](https://i.discogs.com/P8gzSc6VjPkKzuSbOYzaCSSOuRL3GB3iaGOlzyk2aGU/rs:fit/g:sm/q:90/h:595/w:600/czM6Ly9kaXNjb2dz/LWRhdGFiYXNlLWlt/YWdlcy9SLTk5MjU0/MzktMTQ4ODY1MjMy/OS0zODEyLmpwZWc.jpeg), with Yunho being the last person on the [right](https://i.imgur.com/6WzR4Xf.jpg).\n* TVXQ's fanbase is known as **Cassiopeia**, or as **Cassies** for short. Cassies are well, *well* known for being one of the more batshit insane Kpop fandoms. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/bz6jhc/kpop_tvxq_and_the_absolute_worst_sasaengs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) does a great job listing some of the more egregious things Cassiopeia have done across the years, just to give you an idea of the kind of fanbase they're known for being. Cassies are constantly fighting, even now.\n* TVXQ debuted under the company **SM Entertainment**, which is known as one of the \"big 3\" entertainment companies in Kpop. What you need to know about SM is they have resources, connections, and a very unfortunate eye for talent. In order to debut, each member of TVXQ had to sign a contract with SM agreeing to certain terms for a certain length of time.\n\nOkay, that's enough info dumping. Let's talk about what we came here for: gay ship fandom drama. Let's talk about Yunjae.\n\n# 2003-2005: The Beginning of an Era\n\n**Yunjae** is the ship name of TVXQ members [Yunho](https://i.imgur.com/fLLy2Us.jpg) and [Jaejoong](https://i.imgur.com/x2izCZR.jpg). Jaejoong and Yunho are the two oldest members of TVXQ, respectively, with their birthdays being just days apart. Jaejoong and Yunho had already been good friends prior to their debut in TVXQ, which is not always the case in Kpop. There's a lot of stories about how Yunho and Jaejoong originally met, with the most popular one claiming that they first encountered each other in a street fight. However, I have been able to find no evidence of this in English at least, so it's most likely just a rumor.\n\nRegardless of how they met, the important thing is that Yunho and Jaejoong were already friendly and close with each other when TVXQ was debuting. And at a time when most of the other members were still a bit awkward with each other, Yunjae's [level of comfort with each other](https://imgur.com/RVTbMxt) really stood out to people.  Fans rapidly picked up on their [closeness](https://imgur.com/Hdqf9wG), which wasn't hard when you had incidents like [Jaejoong kissing Yunho on the cheek on broadcast](https://media.tenor.com/rlRCGubqs8gAAAAM/angai313-yunjae.gif) in early 2004. Things quickly spiraled from there, as fans began to latch on to every subsequent interaction Yunho and Jaejoong would have with each other.\n\nFrom late 2004, when they released their first album *Tri-angle* (which featured some [truly unfortunate styling](https://imgur.com/a/DlxVsfL)) through the release of their second album [*Rising Sun*](https://imgur.com/a/ScuKnx3) at the end of 2005, Yunjae continued to grow in popularity as a ship. Fansites were beginning to pop up devoted exclusively to talking about Yunjae, capturing Yunjae moments, and stalking Yunjae. There's two very notable fanbases that are going to be important: **Yoonjaepaetch** (**YJP**), the largest Korean based Yunjae fansite, and **YoonJaeLoveBar** (**YJLB**), based out of China and the largest Yunjae fansite by far. These fansites became cornerstones of the fandom, because they had by far the most access to resources and had the most ability to get photos of Yunjae.\n\nAll the while, Yunho and Jaejoong continued to interact (relatively) normally with each other. They just happened to be two guys in a group who were very comfortable with each other. Their dynamic at this point was frequently characterized as them being the mom and dad of the group, due to Jaejoong's love for cooking and Yunho being the leader of the group. Nothing insane. Yet.\n\nTVXQ was becoming increasingly popular throughout this, which means that by the end of 2005, Yunjae had become a somewhat well-known ship in Kpop. Shipping in Kpop wasn't unheard of before this, and there had been fan favorite ships before Yunjae, but these ships had *nothing* on what Yunjae was about to become.\n\n# 2006: Where Things Get Real.\n\nThe year: 2006. The event: a competition hosted by SM entertainment to find the best TVXQ fanfiction. The prize: 1 million won, the possibility for the winner's fanfiction to become a live action drama, and a *date with TVXQ* *themselves.* Yes, you heard that right. [2006 starts with SM hosting an official fanfiction competition where the grand prize was a date with the guys who the fanfiction was about](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/n68aja/sm_fanfic_contest_no_it_actually_happened/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Am I the only one who thinks that's an incredibly bad idea? Just me? We never found out how that went, but I can only assume the answer is terribly, for everyone involved.\n\nAnyways, the existence of this competition shows that by early 2006, SM was catching on to the growing popularity of Yunjae, or at least shipping in general. Realizing that it was drawing a lot of new people into the group, SM did the only logical thing a corporation in a homophobic country in the mid 2000s could do: immediately milk Yunjae for all it was worth. This is how *Dangerous Love* came to be.\n\n**What's Dangerous Love?**\n\n***Dangerous Love*** is half the reason I wanted to write this thing in the first place. *Dangerous Love* is a fever dream. *Dangerous Love* changed everything.\n\nDangerous Love is an episode of the series [*Banjun Drama*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjun_Drama?useskin=vector),or *Reverse Drama* in English. Each episode of *Banjun Drama* was a stand alone mini-drama episode, with celebrity guests invited on to, as Wikipedia put it, \"...act in a very humorous and sarcastic way not seen in regular dramas.\" Think of each episode as if an SNL skit and a Kdrama had a child, and you're on the right path. You can probably tell where this is going---TVXQ were the celebrity guests on an episode, and that episode was *Dangerous Love*.\n\n**But why do we care about Dangerous Love?**\n\nTo understand why we care about *Dangerous Love*, we need to watch *Dangerous Love*. [Dangerous Love is best experienced in its original 480p resolution](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4dwo5w). But for those of you who don't want to watch a 45 minute long episode in Korean, I'll try to sum up the plot:\n\nYunho shows Jaejoong gay fanfiction of the two of them (*Dangerous Love* has TVXQ acting as themselves). Jaejoong reads the gay fanfiction. Jaejoong imagines himself and Yunho as he reads the gay fanfiction. If you watch a single thing from *Dangerous Love*, [watch this](https://youtu.be/jiP2_rZ1TeI?si=Qj3kDH0-g8Te8o0A&amp;t=151). Afterwards, Yunho starts being weirdly nice to Jaejoong, convincing Jaejoong that Yunho is gay for him. The rest of the episode consists of Yunho being nice while Jaejoong is unable to think of anything but him and Yunho being gay together. Sexy music plays every time they interact from now on.\n\nYunho tells Jaejoong that he needs to confess something to him. Jaejoong cuts him off, tells him he understands his feelings, and then gives him the world's least intimate hug. This confuses Yunho, because he is not in fact gay for Jaejoong. He's been acting nice because he broke Jaejoong's new camera. Jaejoong cusses him out, chases him around, everyone laughs, and the episode ends with no actual gay wrongs having been committed. That's *Dangerous Love*.\n\nThis would be insane to film and air anywhere in South Korea in 2006, but just to make sure we are all on the same page about how absurd this is, I need to clarify that *Dangerous Love* aired on *national television*. On a Sunday morning, in a timeslot that was consistently the #1 most watched program on Sundays in the nation. *Dangerous Love* aired to [13.8% viewership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Sunday?useskin=vector#2006). Millions of people, moms, dads, grandparents, watched this gay episode when it aired on TV.\n\nLet's circle back to the part where real life Yunho and Jaejoong have to act out a gay fanfiction of the two of them. Do you notice [the red phone booth Yunho pushes Jaejoong up against](https://imgur.com/a/I2NqAaA)? Thanks to *Dangerous Love*, red phonebooths have since become [highly associated with Yunjae](https://oyunjae.tumblr.com/post/158281846722/%EC%9E%AC%EC%A4%91%EC%95%84-%EC%9D%B4-%EC%95%88-%EC%97%90-%EB%84%88-%EC%9E%88%EB%8B%A4-jaejoong-ah-in-here), to the point where fans have [cosplayed as one to one of Jaejoong's concerts](https://yunjaepouch.tumblr.com/post/158310120331/oyunjae-the-red-phone-booth-jaejoong-chose-hahaha).\n\nAfter this, when people thought of TVXQ, a lot of them would then think about Yunjae. SM was promoting this ship on a national level. And it was working. Dangerous Love was the spark that would ignite the Yunjae Yaoi Inferno of 2006.\n\n**The Yunjae Yaoi Inferno of 2006.**\n\n*Dangerous Love* has aired, and SM has realized they have a verifiable cash cow on their hands in the form of Yunjae. So they start pushing Yunjae, and pushing it hard. \"Pushing\" a ship refers to when a higher power (TV show writers, authors, CEO of SM/[ex-international fugitive](https://www.asianjunkie.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/LeeSooManSuhSeWonInterpol.jpg) Lee Sooman) heavily promote and take steps to try and make a pairing a fan favorite. In Kpop in particular, this usually manifests in idols being told to up the fanservice and skinship with each other. And the reason they are told to do this, and the ways in which they are told to do this, stem from the way Yunjae began to interact from this point on.\n\nBecause *holy shit* did the amount of [touching,](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bd/4e/ad/bd4ead0afaa3c19d98e03c3223e8bcba.gif)  [looking,](https://media.tenor.com/YcQVrPNfj_8AAAAM/angai313-dbsk.gif)  and suggestive comments between Yunho and Jaejoong escalate during this year. And yes, it's obvious that a lot of this was instigated by SM telling them to [amp up the fanservice](https://rawrboysmodemedia.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/0001e87aad2.gif). The thing is that it was *also* obvious that not all of it *was* just fanservice. The reason Yunjae grew so popular was because it wasn't all just for show---you could tell Yunho and Jaejoong genuinely cared about each other as people and as friends on and off camera. So now you have amped up fanservice on camera, combined with acts done \"off camera\" that can be used to argue it's not all for show, and you have a recipe for a whole bunch of fans who genuinely and sincerely believe Yunjae are a real thing.\n\nNot every shipper truly believes that their ship is actually dating behind the scenes, and I'd say these days those fans are in the majority. People ship now because they like dynamics, like to imagine what could happen if they were dating. This was not the case with Yunjae. This was never the case with Yunjae. And why wouldn't it be, when in 2006 alone you had:\n\n* The aforementioned *Dangerous Love.*\n* Yunho and Jaejoong doing... [whatever this is](https://youtu.be/se0opm3nVPQ?si=83MIJba5F3uJOFpL&amp;t=61) on national TV. \"Grinding while hanging from monkey bars\" is the best way I can describe it and yet it still doesn't feel right. Speaking of grinding, what the fuck was going on [here](https://i.makeagif.com/media/2-22-2014/Ngi2XB.gif)?\n* [This photoshoot](https://imgur.com/a/1Ioh0iX). This is one of the times where the order they stand in has changed. Which they did so that Jaejoong and Yunho could... do that?? [Do this](https://ic.pics.livejournal.com/yunjaeandme/48592291/6637/original.gif)?? I don't know. Looking at it makes me laugh every time though.\n* [Lots](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7b/34/0d/7b340da9c407774ba928adc6244b2276.gif) and [lots](https://i.makeagif.com/media/7-09-2019/BcmXvl.gif) and [lots](https://media.tenor.com/vP3JNAJhyK4AAAAM/hug-yun-jae.gif) of the aforementioned touching and [looking](https://twitter.com/i/status/1349627864958734336).\n* Like, this is nowhere *near* all of it. I've been trying to avoid video links but just know that if you search Yunjae moment on YouTube, at least half are going to be from this year alone.\n* It was rumored that Yunho picked Jaejoong up from the police station after [Jaejoong had a DUI](https://forums.soompi.com/topic/13911-jaejoong-gets-caught-for-drunk-driving/) (his only one to date, I should add). This was another case where I could not find any solid English proof beyond a [single photo](https://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h220/azn_lil_babe/YunJaeHo/Candid202848029.jpg) and a lot of people repeating the same thing, so take that with a grain of salt.\n* *Gashiyeon*\n\nActually, I need to talk about *Gashiyeon*. Because *Gashiyeon* is the other 50% of why I wanted to make this writeup. And it only took me a couple thousand words to get there.\n\n# Interlude: it's you, the beauty from class 8.\n\n**What is Gashiyeon?**\n\n***Gashiyeon*** is a Yunjae fanfiction, written in Korean by an author known as Maio. Gashiyeon directly translates to \"thorn lily,\" but the fic is better known in English as \"thorn year.\" I'm going to keep calling it Gashiyeon, because that's what I've always known it as.\n\nGashiyeon was published throughout the course of 2006, and consists of three parts. *Reduced Horizons*, the \"prequel,\" *Thorn Lily*, the main story, and *Fox's Cradle*, the \"sequel.\" The three parts all take place 5-10 years from each other, making Gashiyeon a coming of age slash melodrama slash psychological horror. Although I don't think the last one was intentional. That's just how I felt reading it. (I don't read RPF as a general rule, but this fanfic is so far removed from reality reading it felt like I had been transported to an alternate dimension.)\n\n**Why do we care about Gashiyeon?**\n\nBecause Gashiyeon was a smash hit. Gashiyeon became *insanely* popular amongst Korean Cassiopeias. Obviously Gashiyeon was not one of the first Yunjae fanfictions out there, nor was it one of the longest at that point, but it became *the* most well known one. Gashiyeon became well known and adored for three things: because of its writing style, its plot, and its characterization. And it ended up influencing Cassiopeia, Yunjae shippers, and Yunjae themselves in ways that are still visible today.\n\nThe writing style and plot are the two most important factors in why it got popular, so let's get them out of the way first. According to those who have read it in the original Korean, it is written absolutely beautifully. It supposedly has amazing prose, descriptive imagery, and is rife with symbolism and metaphor. I read [translations](https://egashiyeon.livejournal.com/) that were kindly done [by fans](https://honeyiceblend.livejournal.com/2569.html) for free, and so for me to say anything about the prose would be out of line. I have not read it in the original Korean, and so I have not been able to verify if it's true that Gashiyeon is written masterfully. Even if it was though, not even the best written prose would be able to fix the absolute nightmare that is the plot of Gashiyeon.\n\nTo conceptualize the plot of Gashiyeon, think of the most toxic, mid 2000s yaoi manga/anime/story you have ever encountered. If that is not something you have had the misfortune of experiencing, think of Twilight, except written in a way where everyone is significantly more deranged, and with much more awful sex. Now take either or both of those things and combine them with wisdom teeth, incest, eggs, toe sucking, sandwich innuendos, first degree homicide, and second degree homicide, and you'll have a rough idea of what the plot of Gashiyeon is. Except that story would still be better, by virtue of not being Gashiyeon.\n\nI cannot talk more about the plot without going on a multi-thousand word rant, so instead I will leave you with [this tumblr post](https://yoonje.tumblr.com/post/136236173631), and [this review](https://www.asianfanfics.com/blog/view/421847) of Gashiyeon. Anyways, if you read those posts, you'll notice that they describe the characters somewhat. Which brings us to our next point: the characterization.\n\nGashiyeon's characterization, to put it lightly, fucking sucks. Look, there's always going to be issues when you're writing fanfiction about real people. They're real people, first of all, and it's hard to boil down real living breathing people with all their quirks and flaws to the kind of 2D character archetypes fanfiction so often demands. It's even harder to do so while still keeping the characterized version true to the real person's personality. But no part of Gashiyeon's characterization is in any way shape or form based in reality. I used the 2000s yaoi analogy earlier, and if you're familiar with the typical toxic seme/uke dynamic, it's essentially that but on steroids. If you're not, don't worry, because I'm about to explain our characters.\n\nJaejoong, as a real life human, is a complicated man. He [says whatever is on his mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGV0LTX6rk4), he's prone to questionable tattoo choices and impulse decisions, and he recently [named his fans boss babies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHuEBH-lrYg). But he is also an incredibly caring person down to his core, feels incredibly deeply and passionately, and is a talented [singer and songwriter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19xKWEr6EVI). He has been through hell and had an entire industry turn against him, and eventually came out of it ready to heal and move forward. He is also [so good with children](https://twitter.com/i/status/1467212563993690112), its so cute (don't call [him a baby](https://twitter.com/i/status/1393811584707858433) though).\n\n*Gashiyeon* *Jaejoong*, on the other hand, pushes Yunho's mom down a flight of stairs. Later he pushes Yunho's pregnant wife down another flight of stairs. Separate incidents, ten years apart. No regrets, either. He's incredibly self-centered, an overdramatic diva, and a bitch. He successfully convinces Yunho to cheat on his pregnant wife with him, repeatedly. He's petty, demanding, and his love/obsession with Yunho is his defining trait here. He's primarily the way that he is because of manipulation from Yunho, and in turn manipulates him back. He dies at the end, from an ass bleed that makes him so upset \\[cw: &gt;!suicide!&lt;\\] &gt;!it leads to him slitting his wrists and bleeding out in a bathtub!&lt;.\n\nYunho in real life is also a complicated man, by virtue of being a person. He's incredibly dedicated in everything he does, is known amongst people at SM for cornering artists and [giving them advice for hours at a time](https://tvxqexpress.com/2018/11/09/trans-181108-yunhos-advice-time-mentioned-in-happy-together-4-episode-featuring-fellow-sm-artists/) if left unchecked, and is [fiercely competitive and passionate.](https://www.soompi.com/article/1297633wpp/tvxqs-yunho-reveals-actually-thinks-passionate-sm) He's unerringly loyal (sometimes to a fault), struggled immensely during his time as a trainee, and is [known for going out of his way to help others on a regular basis](https://www.asianjunkie.com/2021/02/24/yunhos-schoolmate-talks-about-how-the-tvxq-member-helped-him-after-school-violence-incident/). He's also a big fan of [home shopping channels on TV](https://www.koreaboo.com/stories/tvxqs-yunho-thought-leather-jacket-fire-proof-heechul-set-fire/), so he's kind of an old man on the inside.\n\n*Gashiyeon Yunho* lets his brother get hit by a car because Jaejoong was in love with him instead of Yunho. He's a manipulative bastard, cheats on his pregnant wife and lies to her about it, and has beat the shit out of Jaejoong multiple times. He verbally abuses and gaslights Jaejoong, and in the prequel realizes he has created a monster via his manipulation and abuse and just abandons Jaejoong and leaves him to get kidnapped. Jaejoong killing his mother and wife is not enough to stop him from getting some. He chooses Jaejoong over his own child time and time again. Yunho also dies at the end, from \\[cw: &gt;!suicide!&lt;\\] &gt;!hanging himself on the day of his anniversary with Jaejoong because why the fuck not.!&lt;\n\nTo give Gashiyeon credit, I'm positive it is in no way the first fic to have this type of characterization. But it is by far the one that had the most impact, and also sucks, and I suffered through all of it, so I get to shit on it all I want. This characterization *could* work, if it was executed well, but it's not.\n\nBut yeah, you get the point. The Yunho and Jaejoong of Gashiyeon are so far removed from reality they might as well just be named Joe and Bob for all that it matters. That didn't matter to the readers, though, because they loved it and soon enough the prevailing way people saw Jaejoong and Yunho were \"high-maintenance jealous bottom with no personality other than being obsessed with Yunho\" and \"possessive overbearing top,\" respectively.\n\n**Gashiyeon's impact**\n\nTo put it bluntly, this fic is responsible for one of the worst fandom feedback loops I know of, one which *still* impacts Cassiopeia to this day. Regardless of how or why it happened, Gashiyeon became very, very famous. Famous enough to become as close to \"mandatory reading\" as you can get in a fandom. The majority of Yunjae shippers at the time, especially the Korean ones, read Gashiyeon. And they took the way Gashiyeon characterized Yunho and Jaejoong and made it their bible. This was the lens they were going to view Yunjae through from then on, until the end of time. Of course, this characterization then begins to pop up in other fics. So then even if you haven't read Gashiyeon, you've read these other fics, and so then you start to see them that way. And so on and so forth. This is unfortunate, but at least it's just a fandom thing and doesn't impact the actual people, right?\n\nWrong. Someone at SM must have caught wind of the fact that these traits were what people wanted to see in Yunjae, and as a result, Yunjae began to play into those tropes. Not to an extreme extent by any means, but you'll notice that a lot of the clips people have labeled with [\"jealous jaejoong\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0KhLBmc8x8) or [\"possessive yunho\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwg7vhd3Cn4) happen beginning in late 2006-early 2007. Some of this spike in popularity is because fans were now looking out for anything that matched these behaviors. Though in comparing some of these interactions to earlier ones, you can see Yunjae [playing into the tropes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6jjH_cOLIY) in ways that they hadn't before. It's a mixture of both, with one influencing the other.\n\nOf course, them playing into it only encouraged fans to keep writing and interpreting their behavior like that, and thus those stereotypes of them have prevailed even to this day, where you *still* see people reducing Yunjae to those cores. Jaejoong in particular, because he kind of got the short end of the stick here. And in a lot of other ways, but that's a later thing.\n\nThe idea of the \"high-maintenance bitchy bottom\" would eventually evolve and go on to become a \"trope\" of the designated \"bottom\" of male kpop idol ships---who would constantly get labeled as [jealous](https://lets-talk-baekyeol.tumblr.com/post/77732144799/jealousbaekhyun) and [petty divas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7_OLqQMWxQ). This stereotyping existed in other spheres *long* before this, but it was Gashiyeon that really brought the trope to Kpop and gave it staying power there. Luckily, as far as I can tell, it *seems* to have died down recently. I'm not really involved with recent Kpop groups, or any shipping that takes place there though. Instead I spend my time writing thousands of words on people from the 2000s I don't even ship. Like a well adjusted normal person.\n\nHow big was Gashiyeon really? There were [three editions](https://blog.naver.com/surfacebook/222502736300) of hard copies of Gashiyeon published and distributed---they weren't officially published by a company, but produced by the author. The most damning sign of the influence Gashiyeon had is that Jaejoong himself seemed to know of it. Someone allegedly asked Jaejoong if he had read Gashiyeon, and he responded with \"isn't that one erotic?\" implying that he knew something of Gashiyeon. I, however, cannot confirm this [beyond old screenshots which could very easily be doctored](https://x.com/Sarangjoongie/status/1042838455078678528?s=20). Given that Jaejoong and Yunho would later go on to admit to reading mpreg fic of the two of them, it wouldn't be off brand for him to know of it..\n\nAnd as one more point to illustrate how well known Gashiyeon was, years later veteran Kpop group H.O.T. would guest on SNL Korea and [act out a sketch that is *heavily* implied to be about Gashiyeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc69_5MH0l4). Like, they straight up quote it. This is like if NSYNC went on SNL and did a sketch where they acted out One Direction fanfiction. And also if one of the members of one direction had previously been so distraught about NSYNC breaking up that he posted on Instagram saying he had nothing left to live for. Because that is in fact what [teenage Jaejoong did when H.O.T. disbanded](https://imgur.com/a/wS2ituH), making it extra funny that they're the ones acting out this fanfiction about him.\n\nBut now I'm done talking about Gashiyeon, we have covered the major Yunjae events of 2006, and we are ready to end the year with [TVXQ in fursuits singing about depression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTfuyxgdCW0), as one does. So let's move on to 2007. Because if you thought we were anywhere close to being done with this rollercoaster, you'd be wrong.\n\n# 2007: The Eye of the Yunjae Hurricane.\n\nSo throughout all of this, TVXQ have been promoting in Japan as Tohoshinki, on top of and in between their \\~yearly Korean comebacks. SM sent them over in 2005 with no ability to speak Japanese, zero translators, almost no support, and had them singing in stairwells and in half filled conference rooms. Somehow this worked and paid off, and by 2007 TVXQ was a big fucking deal in Japan. They were topping the charts, something only done once before by a Korean artist in Japan (BoA). Japan is much more profitable to make music in compared to South Korea, because you can do significantly more concerts there. So it's not uncommon these days for Kpop groups to have random Japanese releases to try and cash in on that market. While second gen groups like KARA, SHINee, Big Bang, and SNSD would gain significant popularity in Japan, nobody who has come after TVXQ has ever been able to do so to the extent that they have. It got to the point where many people in the general public were unaware they were a Korean group at all, only knowing them as Tohoshinki.\n\nSM has them spend all of 2007 in Japan, doing concert tours and releasing singles and not seeing their family. This meant a sharp decrease in the amount of Yunjae content coming out from fansites, as the majority of sites did not have the money to drop everything and go to Japan to take photos of TVXQ. Some did (looking at you YJLB), but most didn't, especially because Japanese concerts tend to have much stricter rules about photography than Korean concerts do. TVXQ were still promoting and appearing on TV in Japan, so people were still able to get their Yunjae fix that way. Not a lot occurred in terms of Korean Yunjae drama in 2007 though, which means now is as good of a time as ever to talk about the fansites a bit more.\n\nThis isn't related to Yunjae as much it is just interesting to me, but it does help put the hobby in this drama post. There were a *lot* of fanbooks and published fanfiction for TVXQ. I'm not talking like doujins or zines, I mean big fat chunky hardcover books. You could have [literal shelves](https://blog.naver.com/xkarmr/222946218039) full of TVXQ fanbooks/fanfiction. Some were hardcover copies of fanfictions that had been published online already, like with Gashiyeon. Others were compilations put out by the fansites themselves. For example, every year YJP would put out [an anniversary book](https://search.pstatic.net/common/?src=http%3A%2F%2Fblogfiles.naver.net%2Fdata33%2F2008%2F8%2F13%2F33%2Fdsc01070_feolia.jpg&amp;type=sc960_832) containing fics, [artwork](https://search.pstatic.net/common/?src=http%3A%2F%2Fcafefiles.naver.net%2Fdata36%2F2009%2F2%2F2%2F131%2F%25BB%25E7%25C1%25F8_022_rosa3207.jpg&amp;type=sc960_832), and fantaken photos that were exclusive to the books themselves and not published online. Coming from an era where everything is digital and there's not nearly as many hard copies of fanbooks being made, I just think it's really fucking cool that this was a thing. I found out a lot about Korean Cassie fan culture and what the major influential fanworks and fansites were in Korea at the time through the process of looking up some of these books and then encountering people talk about them on forum posts made back in the day.\n\nAlso, the two biggest Yunjae sites I mentioned earlier, YJP and YJLB, *hated* each other. YJP and YJLB both had hard bans on posting photos from the other fansite on their respective sites. I don't know *for sure* if it went both ways because YJP's site is now defunct, but from what I saw on other sites there was definite bad blood between the two fansites which continued until YJP's demise, making YJLB the winner of that particular fandom war.\n\nAnyways, this has been a fun detour but we should probably check back in with Yunjae. Surely nothing insane has happened while we were gone and--oh. They are now married. Okay.\n\nWell, \"married,\" heavy on the quotes. On June 10^(th) 2007, during an episode of the radio show they hosted in Japan called BIGEASTATION, Yunho and Jaejoong were [asked which member of TVXQ they'd choose to marry if they had to](https://youtu.be/u1l9bQYHUic). Completely unsurprisingly, they chose each other, and joked that they were now a happily married couple. Poor Junsu was also there and just had to bear witness to this happening in front of him. Obviously Yunjae fans went fucking insane at this, and the day became known as their wedding anniversary, and shippers [still celebrate it to this day](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yunjae16thAnniversary?src=hashtag_click). Like, this day is taken incredibly seriously. Much less so now than a decade ago, but the Yunjae anniversary is sacred to Yunjae shippers all the same.\n\nOverall though, 2007 consists mostly of continuation of the theme of [fanservice with hints of \"more,\"](https://favim.com/pd/s2/orig/28/jaejoong-yunho-yunjae-Favim.com-238841.gif) just in Japan instead of Korea this time. The number of Cassieopeia and Yunjae shippers are still continuing to rise, and while 2006 may have been the peak of the Yunjae Yaoi Inferno, 2008 would propel the group itself to new heights.\n\n\\-\n\n2008 and beyond will be covered in [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/16z33jl/kpop_the_divorce_of_the_century_the_rise_and_fall/) of this story, because this monstrosity ended up being so long it wouldn't fit in a single post.

What if she sent them away a year or two earlier and nobody realizes, because the Grangers are very much disconnected from the Wizarding World by being Muggles?\n\n**TLDR: Hermione could have sent her parents away as early as the summer after 5th Year, but didn't say anything until DHs, when the topic of her parents came up and she had to explain to Harry and Ron.**\n\nHermione had to have realized what grave danger her parents were in, starting after GoF and Voldemort's return. This is in the summer of 1995. Our perception of the books' timeline can be clouded if you read the original run and there was up to three years between publications - but, internally, the breaks between books are somewhere around 2-6 weeks, from the time when Harry finishes a school year to when he gets to leave the Dursleys. \n\nHermione is already at Grimmauld Place when Harry gets there in OotP. During the Christmas break of OotP, she arrives by the Knight Bus after Mr. Weasley's attack, which always came off as strange to me, because - if she didn't go on holiday with her parents but went home from Hogwarts, wouldn't they have brought her by car to London and then she could get to Grimmauld Place on her own? They don't. Hermione very much seems to have snuck out of Hogwarts and got to Grimmauld Place on her own, which would make sense as she using Wizarding transport to arrive to another place in the Wizarding World. This is what made me think that she might not have been anywhere near her parents, but only said that because she was 16 and still underaged in the Wizarding World. Hermione also does not go home for Easter. At this point she has not seen her parents (maybe) since Christmas and if not Christmas, she had definitely has not seen them since the end of GoF, when they ended 4th Year. Again, she appears to spend a very short amount of time with them before going to Grimmauld Place and being there for a while before Harry gets there by the opening of OotP.\n\nBy the summer holidays of 1996, right before their 6th Year, she is again already at The Burrow when Harry arrives - and this is WAY earlier in the summer than he usually arrives. Strange, again. \n\nDoesn't she want to see her parents? Summer is the most significant break she gets and she's away at a boarding school for most of the year in a world her parents aren't a part of. Not to mention! Wouldn't her parents want to keep her home and resting or maybe be reluctant to let her go back to the Wizarding World so soon after being hurt that badly the Department of Mysteries - which JUST HAPPENED a couple of weeks earlier. From our perspective, HBP was published 2 years after OOTP, but again, internally, not that much time had passed. \n\nShe does appear to go home for Christmas in HBP - but, by this time, Hermione is 17 and a legal adult in the Wizarding World. Who says she went home? There would be nobody that could make her return to her Muggle parents' custody. Does anyone verify this by seeing/meeting the Grangers on the platform? Do we hear anything about them, except \"Hermione has gone home for the holiday and is not at The Burrow\"? She might have stayed in Hogsmeade or Diagon Alley, for all we know, and just told someone she was going back home.\n\nThen, she doesn't go home for Easter and then, the end of HBP happens, which is when we presume that she put the plan to send her parents away into motion. \n\nBut, really - do we really know that the Grangers weren't bewitched and sent away well before the summer of 1997, when she finally says this to Harry and Ron? This is a child who brew Polyjuice Potion at 12/13 years old. I don't believe at all that a complex memory spell would have been out of her wheelhouse at 15-16 years old.\n\nAs well, Muggles can't just go to another country and set up a life in a few days like a wizard might be able to. They would have had to apply for some type of immigration permission up to a whole year or maybe 2 years - and, although they are very likely to have been approved by being dentist, the process doesn't speed up or lose steps because a Muggleborn child needs it to. \n\nWhat thoughts to you all have on this? I'm VERY interested to see if anyone feels this is possible or has at least speculated on this line of thought, like I have been for a while...","subreddit":"harrypotter","comments":120,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/17fdgkr/theory_hermione_sent_her_parents_away_well_before/","_row":"87"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-12","timestamp":1697131799,"title":"Miami Beach with Perfect Public Transportation","text":"All we can do is dream","subreddit":"Miami","comments":181,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/176ciau/miami_beach_with_perfect_public_transportation/","_row":"88"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-22","timestamp":1697980868,"title":"\"They want what we have (the ability to travel cross country without using public transportation)\"","text":"ok so now we don't even have cars and roads","subreddit":"ShitAmericansSay","comments":79,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitAmericansSay/comments/17dt5ix/they_want_what_we_have_the_ability_to_travel/","_row":"89"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-02","timestamp":1696206954,"title":"If you ever feel useless, remember that Dirty Ice has security modifiers","text":"","subreddit":"paydaytheheist","comments":39,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/16xi63u/if_you_ever_feel_useless_remember_that_dirty_ice/","_row":"90"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-08","timestamp":1696723535,"title":"The prosperous and wealthy American middle class of the 1950s and 1960s was a historical abnormality and it is never coming back.","text":" \n\nBoomers just had a super good time for a couple of decades because of circumstances that we can't repeat and many people in the US really struggle to wrap their heads around this notion.\n\nA large and affluent middle class is the cornerstone of the American dream. A dream in which anyone with a high school diploma and hard work should easily afford a nice house in the suburbs, 2 cars and a nice vacation with the family to a cool place once a year. Americans assume that this is the way the universe should work. That things were always like this, and that Americans have the \"God given right\" of the American dream.\n\nHowever, this reality of a exceptionally wealthy and prosperous middle class by global standards is NOT the norm or the natural way of things, but a by product of a very unique and relatively recent set of historical circumstances, specifically, the end of World War II. At the end of the second world war, the US was the only major industrial power left with its industry and infrastructure unscathed. This gave the US a dramatic economic advantage over the rest of the world, as all other nations had to buy pretty much everything they needed from the US, and use their cheap natural resources as a form of payment.\n\nAfter the end of world War II, pretty anywhere in the world, if you needed tools, machines, vehicles, capital goods, aircraft, etc...you had little choice but to \"buy American\". So money flowed from all over the world into American businesses.\n\nBut the the owners of those businesses had to negotiate labor deals with the American relatively small and highly skilled workforce. And since the owners of capital had no one else they could hire to men the factories, many concessions had to be given to the labor unions. This allowed for the phenomenal growth and prosperity of the US middle class we saw in the 50s and 60s: White picket fence houses in the suburbs, with 2 large family cars parked in front was the norm for anyone who worked hard in the many factories and businesses that dotted the American landscape back then.\n\nHowever, over time, the other industrial powers rebuild themselves and started to compete with the US. German and Japanese cars, Belgian and British steel, Dutch electronics and French tools started to enter the world market and compete with American companies for market share. Not only that, but countries like Brazil, South Africa, India, China, Mexico, Thailand, Turkey, South Korea and more also became industrialized. This meant that they were no longer selling their natural resources cheaply in exchange for US made industrial goods. Quite the contrary, they themselves started to bid against the US for natural resources to fuel their own industries. And more importantly, the US work force no longer was the only one qualified to work on modern factories and to have proficiency over modern industrial processes. An Australian airline needs a new commercial jet? [Brazil's EMBRAER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-3m__yRBkg) and European Airbus can offer you products as good as anything made in the US. Need power tools or a pickup truck? You can buy American, but you can also buy South Korean, Indian or Turkish.\n\nThis meant that the US middle class could no longer easily outbid pretty much everyone else for natural resources, and the owners of the capital and means of production no longer were \"held hostage\" by this small and highly skilled workforce. Many other countries now had an industrial base that rivals or surpasses that of the US. And they had their own middle classes that are bidding against the US middle class for those limited natural resources. And manufacturers now could engage in global wage arbitrage, by moving production to a country with cheaper labor, which killed all the bargaining power of the unions.\n\nIf everyone in the world lived and consumed like what the average American sees as a reasonable middle class lifestyle (i.e. drive an F-150 or an SUV, families with multiple cars, living in a house in the suburbs, high meat consumption, etc...), [it would take 4.1 Earths to provide enough resources to sustain that lifestyle](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33133712). But we don't have 4.1 Earths, we have just one. And unlike before, the USA no longer can outbid the rest of the world for those limited resources.\n\nGRAPH: [The U.S. Share of the Global Economy Over Time](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/u-s-share-of-global-economy-over-time/)\n\nThat is where the decline of the US middle class is coming from. There are no political solutions for it, as no one, not even Trump's protectionism or the Democrat's Unions, can put the globalization genie back into a bottle. It is the way it is. Any politician who claims to be able to restore \"the good old days\" is lying. So yes, the old middle class lifestyle of big house, big car, all you can eat buffet, shop until you drop while golfing on green grass fields located in the middle of the desert is not coming back no matter what your politician on either side of the isle promised you.\n\nWe are going back to the normal, where the US middle class is not that different from the middle classes from the rest of the world. Like a return to what middle class expectations are elsewhere, including the likes of Europe, Japan, South Korea and Malaysia. Their cars are smaller. They don't change cars as often. The whole family might share a single car. Some families don't even own a car and rely on public transportation instead. Their homes are smaller. They don't eat as much meat and their food portions are smaller.\n\nThey are not starving. They are not living like peasants. But their standard of living is lower than what we in the US have considered a \"middle class\" lifestyle since the end of World War II.\n\n**Now, that is not to say that there isn't a lot of inequality in the US or to deny that policies are needed to address that inequality**. But my issue with most of the \"give us equality\" folks in the US is that they imagine the rich being taxed so that they can finally afford that house in the burbs and the F-150 in the driveway like their parents were able to. That is NOT going to happen for the reasons I've already explained. No amount of taxation and public policy will make that happen. That version of the middle class is never coming back. Where I see public policy for wealth redistribution having an active and effective role is making healthcare more affordable, making the cities more walkable and livable so that young Americans can transition from the suburbs to smaller and more affordable homes in dense urban neighborhoods where cars are not a basic necessity to earn income. Our middle class will become more like other countries' middle classes. That cannot be changed. What we can aim for is having our social services and social safety nets more in line to what exits and is available for the middle classes of those other countries.","subreddit":"economy","comments":190,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/172kyqh/the_prosperous_and_wealthy_american_middle_class/","_row":"91"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-05","timestamp":1696503850,"title":"Anyone else really just not able to stand men at this point?","text":"Please don\u0019t take this as discrimination! \n\nI was on the train the other day minding my own business when a man asked if he could sit in the seat next to me.

Jean-Luc, you said that it was a joke.\u001d Victor notes calmly even as he tries not to gawk at the fact that Jean-Luc does in fact have an overabundance of butter. An overabundance of butter that he has in fact shipped over to Shellgather in order to encourage a feast, and promote a product. That and apparently Jean-Luc wanted some for himself, so he was showing up with an ingredient.\n\n\u001cThe joke is that it\u0019s possible to have too much butter. It\u0019s not.\u001d Jean-Luc says and Victor huffs in frustration, but welcomes the man\u0019s presence regardless.\n\nApparently the violent Frenchman was more offended at the lack of good food than he had been publicly letting on as he had apparently been funding a huge amount of efforts to make a mass amount of human tasting foods that non-humans could actually eat without spontaneously combusting or going into mass organ failure.\n\nApparently Garlic Butter was his latest smash success that he had been too busy selling to actually crow about. Victor is going to have to ask for a look at Jean-Luc\u0019s profit margins, if selling food is better than selling medicine he\u0019s going to have to shift his focus on things ever so slightly. Of course there\u0019s always the consideration that a market can easily get over saturated.\n\nThe butter is warmed and the Deep Scuttler that he killed has all it\u0019s limbs torn off to be boiled in different pots. There\u0019s a bit of a mess as he helps peel away the shell around the main body and finds that although the organs of a Deep Scuttler can be best described as simple, they\u0019re still in a shattered state due to his kicks and need to be literally hosed away before it can be eaten.\n\nThe main body goes on a grill over an open flame as Jean-Luc is painting it with a bucket of his \u0018garlic butter\u0019 and adding all sorts of little extras that add flavour without actually hurting anyone. The legs and claws merrily boil away and the brown of the shell turns a bright cherry red.\n\nThe feast is small, more a snack really as one Deep Scuttler for an entire town is slim pickings. But everyone gets a taste at least, and Jean-Luc promptly gets himself numerous requests for the butter and he passes out numerous pamphlets and little brochures of the products he\u0019s selling. Well played on his part, especially as the butter had made the meal. The Deep Scuttler hadn\u0019t had much taste of it\u0019s own but carried taste like an absolute champion and had a wonderful texture.\n\n\u001cSo, what do you think? Tasty? Should we add hunting Deep Scuttlers to the list of products?\u001d\n\n\u001cBesides the fact that they\u0019re very powerful and dangerous. Absurd supersoldier silliness that you can do aside my lord, they\u0019re the prey of the Mirage Whales. I don\u0019t want to potentially upset a being so large that it can be walked upon by a whole family while it sleeps with it\u0019s nose in the air.\u001d Beatrice says sand Victor can nod at that logic.\n\n\u001cThat said... it may be wise to have a few locals start training up to an Undaunted Level. I understand it seems... heh... daunting. But it is worthwhile.\u001d Victor notes.\n\n\u001c... Is it true that you recruit only men?\u001d Beatrice asks and Victor blinks.\n\n\u001cNo, but we do give preferable treatment to men that sign up. This is mostly because for humans men are the warriors and hunters, but also in that many men lack direction and purpose in the galaxy at large. Time in the military is many things, purposeless is not one of them.\u001d Victor says.\n\n\u001c... Would you be willing to train apprentices?\u001d She asks and Victor considers.\n\n\u001cI hadn\u0019t considered an apprentice system before. Mass training is how I received my own abilities.\u001d\n\n\u001cIf we download basic in to their heads with the speed up method then we could help them personally. If we\u0019re just doing one or two.\u001d Jean-Luc says as he walks over.\n\n\u001cThe conversation could have been private you know.\u001d Victor chides him.\n\n\u001cWas it?\u001d Jean-Luc challenges.\n\n\u001cNo, but... honestly man.\u001d\n\n\u001cSure. Anyways, I heard something about training the locals more. I\u0019m surprised you haven\u0019t pushed that harder.\u001d\n\n\u001cThere is a great deal of damage to reverse after the pirate gangs cleared the boats away. The towns need time to find their bearing again.\u001d Victor says.\n\n\u001cAnd in the meantime we\u0019ve already been attacked more than once. The sooner you have someone here that you can trust to at least slow down, if not outright stop an enemy attack the better.\u001d\n\n\u001cYes, but if there\u0019s nothing here to protect because the infrastructure and livelihoods of the people have been neglected then it\u0019s just empty land of little value.\u001d Victor says frankly.\n\n\u001cWell, how much time do you have yet? We\u0019ve been on here for just about a year now. How much do you want to bet that we\u0019re due for another idiot any day now?\u001d Jean-Luc asks.\n\n\u001cAnd what do you suggest then? Grab everyone who looks like they can hold something vaguely threatening and download the Undaunted Training into their minds before running them ragged until they could conceivably conquer a planet on their own?\u001d\n\n\u001cWell... I was thinking more about looking into what our good Duchess has been doing with Moira Octarilly. Knights.\u001d\n\n\u001cI see...\u001d Victor notes. \u001cWell, I\u0019ll need to get a training arena finished first. Three in fact, Aerial Combat, Grounded Combat and Aquatic Combat.\u001d\n\n\u001cOr you could do what I\u0019m going to do soon.\u001d Jean-Luc says and Victor slowly turns to regard him fully. \u001cTournaments! Public entertainment too! Bread and circuses are easy when you\u0019ve funded a dozen bakeries and are setting up the tents for the show.\u001d\n\n\u001c... Is this a strange way for you to challenge my territory?\u001d Victor asks.\n\n\u001cWhat? No! No... yes.\u001d\n\n\u001c...\u001d Victor just gives Jean-Luc the stink-eye.\n\n\u001cI\u0019m not just challenging you. But we do need this world to have a bit more of a... martial culture. Tournaments to celebrate strength and unity.\u001d Jean-Luc says. \u001cTake it from a Frenchman, it doesn\u0019t matter how many wars you win, you just need to lose once or twice to get a reputation for it.\u001d\n\n\u001cAnd take it from a Russian, forcing people into jobs they don\u0019t want does not work for anyone.\u001d Victor returns.\n\n\u001cHmm...\u001d Jean-Luc remarks before looking out over the water Shellgather is built on. \u001cJust consider it. Not only will you be part of this. But so will everyone else.\u001d\n\n\u001cYou\u0019ve spoken to the others?\u001d\n\n\u001cYou\u0019re the last.\u001d\n\n\u001cEven Franklin?\u001d\n\n\u001cYou were underwater for about an hour. I was talking to everyone then but you were in potentially hostile territory.\u001d\n\n\u001cPotentially hostile?\u001d\n\n\u001c... to your virginity?\u001d Jean-Luc jokes and Victor raises an incredibly unimpressed eyebrow. \u001cRight, anyways. What do you think?\u001d\n\n\u001cI think that if you want to have a travelling tournament that\u0019s fine. You\u0019re being very circumspect about this.\u001d\n\n\u001cNot everyone was too happy with the idea that I wanted to have a tournament.\u001d Jean-Luc admits.\n\n\u001cWhy?\u001d\n\n\u001cDuchess Lilpaw wants to have knighthoods and things like that as a reward for recruitment as she\u0019s done with Moira. Franklin is thinking about opening up Axiom collages to train people to use it the same way he does. Marcus wants more organized legions and basically it keeps going. Everyone has their own ideas... Jake\u0019s scares me the most in that he simply wants to up arm everyone to the point that trying to take any city or town will be met with a wall of laser fire and plasma.\u001d\n\n\u001cWell... if you try to phrase it differently it could work out the same way for you without stepping on too many toes.\u001d Victor notes even as he sees a few smaller children of the community deciding that they wanted to steal the shell left over from the Deep Scuttler and were running off with part of a leg segment over their heads and their mother chasing after. \u001cAnyways, this is a conversation for more formal consideration. Not just you trying to ambush me with the idea.\n\n\u001cRight, well I\u0019m just floating it for now. We have our fleets, we have our crews, we have the Barons protecting areas.\u001d\n\n\u001cAnd defensive satellites, we\u0019re looking into massive shields and we are training a legitmate army.\u001d\n\n\u001cI just want some kind of stopgap. Local wardens or officers...\u001d Jean-Luc says.\n\n\u001cI understand, but it\u0019s still something that needs more consideration. It\u0019s not a bad idea, but it needs a bit more meat on it than just a basic description. What level of training and... I just said this was for more formal settings. I\u0019m done discussing this for now. Please.\u001d Victor says and Jean-Luc sighs.\n\n\u001cFine. Fine, my little mining towns will figure something more out.\u001d Jean-Luc says as he considers. \u001cAre you sure that these Deep Scuttlers won\u0019t be up for trade? They\u0019re tasty enough to make a good lobster substitute.\u001d\n\n\u001cThey\u0019re entirely for the Mirage Whales. Unless you want to negotiate with them, you\u0019re not getting anything other than the very rare catch.\u001d\n\n\u001cWell, do keep me on the shortlist for people to sell them to. I love lobster, so I\u0019ll pay very well for Deep Scuttler.\u001d Jean-Luc says. \u001cStill, if there\u0019s nothing more for me to be gained for. And no jumping for joy at my tournament idea, I\u0019ll just be heading home then. It was wonderful to meet you all and best of luck with this place Victor. I\u0019m sure you\u0019ll have all kinds of fun with it.\u001d\n\n\u001cIt\u0019s not about fun. It\u0019s about duty.\u001d\n\n\u001cI\u0019m sure it is.\u001d Jean-Luc says. \u001cJust try to have some fun before you crack okay?\u001d\n\nWith that Jean-Luc finds his way back to his own transportation, handing out the rest of his little pamphlets and advertisements as he does so, and blasts away.\n\n\u001cExcuse me?\u001d A young voice around Victor\u0019s thigh asks and he looks down to see a young boy, one with very watery eyes and a clear amount of fear on his little Merra face.\n\n\u001cYes young man?\u001d Victor asks kneeling down to be closer and less intimidating.\n\n\u001cUh... someone said you want to train up men to be warriors... does that mean me?\u001d\n\n\u001cYou\u0019re too young. Maybe for the cadet program we\u0019ve got. But not for actually fighting in battle.\u001d\n\n\u001cWhat\u0019s a cadet?\u001d\n\n\u001cSomeone who gets the easier training and jobs. Think of it like proper practice for training and being a military man.\u001d\n\n\u001cIs it hard?\u001d\n\n\u001cFor some people it\u0019s very hard. Being military isn\u0019t for everyone. But for those that fit in with the military? It\u0019s great. It was great for me when I was younger. Before I could even legally drive a vehicle I could shoot many kinds of gun, set up a camp and knew how to call in coordinates for an attack or artillery strike.\u001d Victor says with a smile. \u001cIn some ways, I\u0019ve been military since I was as big as you.\u001d\n\n\u001cYou were as small as me once?\u001d\n\n\u001cEveryone starts off small and weak. Even Undaunted. Even Primals. You need to work at being strong to actually be strong.\u001d Victor assures the young man. \u001cNow, if you want to join a cadet program. That can be done. It DOES however work at a central location, so for part of the day you\u0019ll be far away from here, but you\u0019ll be with other children who want to grow and be strong enough to fight for Vucsa.\u001d\n\n\u001cI want that!\u001d\n\n\u001cDo you? Well... a moment please.\u001d Victor says as he starts patting as his pockets. He finds it in his inside vest pocket. \u001cHere we are. Bring this to your family. Your mother, Head Mother or Father. Tell them you want to be a cadet.\u001d\n\n\u001cWhat is it?\u001d The boy asks taking it.\n\n\u001cIt\u0019s the answers to several questions that come up a lot and ways for them to learn more. We\u0019re not recruiting any cadets without parental permission.\u001d\n\n\u001cOh...\u001d The boy says.\n\n\u001cWhat\u0019s wrong?\u001d Victor asks.\n\n\u001cI... I\u0019m adopted. The boat thieves...\u001d\n\n\u001cOh... I see.\u001d Victor says as he thinks. \u001cAnd your adoptive family? Are they treating you well?\u001d\n\n\u001cThey are it\u0019s just... I miss them.\u001d The child says and Victor nods.\n\n\u001cAnd you always will. But that\u0019s something that becomes easier to deal with. You\u0019re getting a little stronger to hold that up. That\u0019s what it means to be alive.\u001d Victor assures him.\n\n\u001cOkay...\u001d The little Merra boy says.\n\n\u001cHow about I walk you home then?\u001d Victor offers.\n\n\u001cOkay...\u001d The boy says and Victor stands up straight as he gives Beatrice a questioning look. She nods.\n\n\u001cWhich way little man?\u001d Victor asks and the Merra boy points down the town.\n\n\u001cHis name is Drake.\u001d Beatrice whispers to Victor as he starts to follow her. \u001cHis family was made an example of. The whole community took him in after that. It became the Kelpknot family officially after the Night of Blood.\u001d\n\n\u001cGot it.\u001d Victor confirms. \u001cThank you.\u001d\n\n\u001cMy pleasure.\u001d Beatrice says as she follows along. Clearly interested in how he intends to deal with the family.\n\nAN: 404 Brain not found.

In the uk a lot of people think of Poland as being this poor grey country full of commie blocks and poverty. But I was so surprised at what I saw. The average village/suburb in Poland looks way nicer than the average village/suburb in the uk most of our housing is 1940s-1980s era terraced houses or big old blocks of flats similar to commie blocks in eastern and Central Europe. The houses are really nice looking, better built and bigger with bigger gardens, even the poorer areas in polish cities and towns look far less derelict and slummy than most poorer areas in the uk. it\u0019s far more developed than the uk in regards to infrastructure, higher quality public transport etc. towns and cities are way cleaner and safer than the majority of towns and cities in the uk especially around where I live. And the quality of life in general just seems a lot better than the uk. Idk if anyone who\u0019s been to Poland and the uk can relate to this experience.

I can't drive, so my wife has to drive me to and from work daily. This is only a 15 minute commute, but unfortunately it crosses state lines so I can't use public transportation. My job provides our health insurance, a penssion if I stay long enough, and enough money to cover our fixed monthly expenses, plus a couple hundred extra. \nMy wife started her job 3 years ago at $15/hr, and now makes $16.40/hr. We just had our first child, and she was promised a raise 30 days after returning from maternity leave. After 30 days, she was told that she needed to wait another 30 days and that her request for  a raise would be re-evaluated at that time. This is coming from the CEO of the company, and at this point it's not looking like a raise is very likely. She does work from home, but unfortunately the requirements of the job are too demanding, so she can't watch our son. A family friend is watching him for $200 a week. However, the total daily commute for my wife to drive me to and from work, and our son to and from our friend's house, is 75 miles and 3 hours. This makes for an 11 hour day for my wife. After the expense of daycare and fuel, my wife's take home pay is $1000 a month, which we need to cover groceries and other expenses. We have enough in savings to cover this for at least a year. This isn't considering extra car maintenance, depreciation, etc. Driving our son to and from our friend's house for daycare is an extra 520 miles a month, as compared to just driving me to and from work. We've been averaging about 2,000 miles a month between work and personal driving. We only currently have one vehicle with just over 51,000 miles, so this isn't a huge issue for the short term. \nWe're trying to decide whether my wife should quit her job as we get closer to the winter months. My father owns a small moving business and is hoping to be able to hire her within a few months to do bookkeeping, scheduling, and other office work, but this isn't a 100% guarantee. There are also some opportunities through people he works with to sell items on eBay and Facebook marketplace, but this also wouldn't be a guaranteed income. \nIf my wife needed to find another full time job after quitting this one, she would need the flexibility to be able to pick up and drop off myself and our son, which might be an issue for some companies. \nWhat would you all do in our situation? She's leaning toward quitting, but losing the guaranteed paycheck is scary, especially with a new baby.","subreddit":"personalfinance","comments":390,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/17bj53d/should_my_wife_quit_her_job/","_row":"96"},{"date_utc":"2023-10-22","timestamp":1698009411,"title":"To the anti-car car owners here","text":" It seems like these days there are a lot of posts along the lines of \"I hate cars but I have to have one for work/because my city has inadequate public transportation\" \n\n My 2 cents: you have nothing to feel guilty about or apologize for and you don't lose your \"anti-car card\" for this. \n\n People may disagree with me here but I don't blame individual car owners. I blame cities and governments and big oil. I think it would be misguided to shift all the blame to individuals, just like corporations and media have managed to do with recycling. One person throws their beer cans in the garbage and everyone freaks out. Corporations create huge amounts of garbage and don't recycle anything cuz it costs money to do and everyone thinks it's just business. \n\n You don't need to feel guilt. First of all, your guilt is not doing anyone any favours. Not yourself, and not those of us without cars. If your city has really forced you to drive when you hate cars, your city should hear your complaints. Do at least some light activism. Spread awareness. Just feeling bad is bad for you and useless for everyone. Spending some energy to at least try and enact some change, even when it doesn't work, feels very rewarding. Your activism very probably won't make America not be America overnight, but just seeing how much this group has grown in size, something is working and a very gradual cultural shift is happening. \n\n On a similar note, I doubt that many queer activists in the 80s would believe what the landscape would look like for queer folk in 2023. Not that there are zero issues there anymore, but as much as each of those activitists may have felt like what they were doing isn't gonna fix anything, it did move things in the right direction.\n\n Also, in the meantime, just be a good driver. Don't overuse your car. Minimize trips. Use it when you have to. Don't park obnoxiously and don't do it on the bike lane. Watch out and look after cyclists and pedestrians. Don't splash people when it rains. Don't stop at the pedestrian crossing at a red. Call out other bad drivers.","subreddit":"fuckcars","comments":101,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/17e3k1x/to_the_anticar_car_owners_here/","_row":"97"},{"date_utc":"2023-09-30","timestamp":1696103284,"title":"PART TWO: HOW TO CONTACT YOUR CONGRESS MEMBERS - MADE EASY! <\u000e International &amp; US Apes - Get Involved! <\u000e Here's how YOU can help protect the SEC =¨ Don\u0019t Let Congress Defund Market Structure Reform! =¨","text":"**EDIT:**\n\n**Just heard word that we need to find another means for international apes to get involved in this action - so for now, this post will be tailored only for American audiences.

Once thought to be mere myth; proven now to have existed. The more they learn of their predecessors... the stranger it all becomes.*\n\n\"They came to our world so far back in history we consider it 'prehistoric' - and yet, they seem to have vanished without a trace. our first knowledge of them came from a painting. A cave painting, made by one of the many short-lived evolutionary lines on our world. We call them the Voral Mazarium.... an early sapient insectoid species, cut off far too short due to high predatory rates from displaced carnivores when the humans arrived.\"\n\n*Much of this is known by now; the humans, the Mazarium, how they are both parts of our history yet how much we know of one vastly outpaces the other. Hatchlings are being taught what little is known in school these days; the lizard speaker sees some youth there with their clutch mothers, staring up at her in amazement. excitement. She sees the look in her eyes as the same look her professor gained from her when they met; a smile creeps across her face as she too becomes excited by the situation.*\n\n\"Little is known why they came, nor is it known why they left. My family has been working on what we refer to as the SABEL drive - a state of the art transport system that allows one to move from one point in space to another without needing to do all of that pesky travelling in the middle. It shows great promise; collapsing space in on itself using a singularity core so that we may travel the in-between - the more power we put in, the further we travel, but the less accurate it becomes. so far, we've managed to collapse space by about 15000 percent - allowing us to travel, effectively, at fifteen times the speed of light. In theory, at least. the tests have all been small scale, and today...\" *She glances towards her colleagues across the room; those she has called her family; the Kalith that stood by her - and clears her throat, quills trembling with trepidation.*\n\n\"I, N'keem N'toth of the United Kalith of Vorn Aerospace division, daughter of B'taal N'toth, scientist of the United Kalith of Vorn Interkalith science academy, have the honour of testing our first ever official SABEL drive-craft. I will be taking one mighty gust for the future of the Vorn. Our first step in finding out why these humans came here... why they left, and who exactly they were - the grand precursors? explorers? conquerors? we will find the *truth*!\"\n\n*Every single person in the auditorium stands and cheers - this has been in the public eye for a decade now; the work they've been putting in towards mastering interstellar travel. All of it has been for progress - for the unending question, the mystery of humanity, their purpose, their presence. How they got here - why they came here - how and why they disappeared so completely yet left just enough proof to show they were here - all of it has been boggling our kind for a century now.*  \n*Some still worship them; others doubt they were real, calling it all the world's biggest hoax. She can't help but sympathize a little; scale-less, hairless bipedals with flaming wings and blue halos sounds exactly like something out of a religious text; but too much evidence suggests they really existed. The technology they must have had is staggering. Ruins that cannot be; strange metals and glassworks that do not match any compounds we know, that have lasted longer than any structure possibly should - fossilized remains, lined neatly in the stone too perfect to be coincidence. Cave paintings showing their arrival and... general appearance, albeit with the artistic talent of a Wrak slug. Sounds with no source, words with no soun.*\n\n\"My Kalith... my family has been trying to get to the stars for generations. We pioneered the colonization of our moons, hell, we're even trying to terraform one of our sister worlds. these humans... many called it an unhealthy obsession, but every single one of us no matter how isolationist cannot help but be drawn to the story of humans - and nobody is actually sure why.\n\nWe must get to the bottom of this. It's our blood. Our history.\n\nWe must find out what happened to the humans!\"\n\n[Next Chapter](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/175jxk2/what_on_earth_happened_to_the_humans_ch1/)\n\n# Authors Note\n\nGreetings, HFY'ers!
